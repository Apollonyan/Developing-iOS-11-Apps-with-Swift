Stanford University. >> Okay,
斯坦福大学

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:13,845
well welcome to Lecture 6, Stanford CS193P,
欢迎参加斯坦福 CS193P 的第六节课

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,183
Fall of 2017. So today I'm gonna continue that demo that
现在是 2017 年秋季学期。

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,620
I started last time. It's gonna be gigantic demo today,

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,790
covering mostly stuff having to do with custom views.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,524
Then I come back to the slides,

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,826
just a few brief slides on multi touch and

9
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,664
how we do that. Then we'll go back to the demo and add some

10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,568
multi touch gestures to our little playing card thing.

11
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,705
Here's the old slide of what's you're gonna learn today,

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,541
which you go back and look at this slide after the demo.

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,812
Then try to decide, did I learn that, well, we will find

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,048
out. By the way between last lecture and this lecture, I

15
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,318
went ahead and finished off a custom string convertible for

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,187
all three of these things. I just made suits custom

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,591
string,convertible return its raw value, remember its raw

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,928
values are these little equals things here. And then rank,

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,597
I had to actually implement a little description,

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,600
right there, where I returned A for the one. And then

21
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:12,871
a string version of a number, or the kind J, Q, or K. But

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,941
once I implemented custom strings convertible on

23
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,277
all three of these things. And then this code we had back

24
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:22,114
here where we just printed out ten random cards,

25
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,583
that prints out a lot nicer on the console.

26
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,885
So let's take a look and see what it does now.

27
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,587
See, it just prints it out here as kind of an abbreviated

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,757
version, which is, if you're debugging, it's a lot nicer to

29
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,926
be printing your cards out and seeing that.

30
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,530
And you might want to do the same thing in your assignment

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,734
number three as well. So that's it for that.

32
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,037
We've completely finished our model for

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,139
this MVC, that we're building here, this app,

34
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,176
this PlayingCard, so we have a deck of playing cards.

35
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:55,546
So now it's time to dive in to drawing these, these cards.

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,616
And we're gonna do that with a custom UIView subclass, which

37
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,853
is I'm gonna call PlayingCard view. Now you create a custom

38
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,589
view in the same way you create other classes.

39
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,859
So you're gonna do File > New > File. But here instead of

40
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,529
picking Swift File, which is like a UI independent thing,

41
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,801
you're gonna pick Cocoa Touch Class. That's because our UI

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,306
view is a subclass of a cocoa touch or UI kit class.

43
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:25,010
So I'm gonna call it, playing, playing card view,

44
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,980
it's gonna be subclass of UIView. A lot of other UI kit

45
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:33,718
things can be subclassed here, but the one I want is UIView.

46
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,821
And it says, where you wanna put it? By the way,

47
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,890
I just wanna remind you all, some of you are putting your

48
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,960
files at the top level, the project level, so they're

49
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,962
ending up like next to your X code project right there.

50
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,799
You really wanna be putting them down a level in here.

51
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,802
This is where we collect all of our classes. So just

52
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,505
a little reminder there, we're seeing that on the homework.

53
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,408
And so here's my UIView subclass, look at this, see?

54
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,576
Subclass of UIView, that's great.

55
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,913
And it even gave me a stub of a very important method here,

56
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,450
which of course, is our draw rect. Now, you notice this is

57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,853
commented out, in this stub, that's because this iOS

58
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,656
actually looks to see if you have a draw rect.

59
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,025
And if you do, it makes an off screen buffer for

60
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,694
you, and all kinds of preparations for you to draw,

61
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,163
okay, and that's not cheap, it's not free.

62
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,766
So if you don't actually draw in your draw rect,

63
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,236
then you would want to leave it commented out.

64
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,839
Now why would you ever have a UIView, or UIView subclass

65
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,443
that doesn't have a draw rect? Well, that's actually quite

66
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,878
common, you do all your drawing with subviews,

67
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,182
consider UI stack view, right? It's a UIView, it does all its

68
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,851
drawing with views that are stacked inside of it.

69
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,054
It doesn't do any actual drawing itself, it has no draw

70
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,124
rect, right? But we are gonna have a draw rect, of course,

71
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,559
because we are going to be drawing a playing card.

72
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,830
Now I'm actually just, for example purposes here,

73
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,765
I'm gonna draw some of my card with sub views and

74
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,202
some of my card with this draw rect, okay. So that way you'll

75
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,705
get to see one view that actually does both. And

76
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,341
in your homework assignment, you're probably gonna have at

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,976
least one view that does subviews, and

78
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,078
at least one view that has a draw rect. So

79
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,016
you'll be able to see all that at action, in action here.

80
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,085
All right, so we got this PlayingCardView. Let's go back

81
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,889
over to our storyboard right here, and put a UI view,

82
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,626
a PlayingCardView basically, into our UI, okay.

83
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,096
So how do we do that? Well, how do we put views in our UI?

84
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,032
We go over here to utilities and down at the bottom,

85
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,735
maybe we drag out a button, or we drag a label.

86
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,105
And of course where is playing card view? Well, it's not in

87
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,775
here, of course, cuz these are all just the things that come

88
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,579
with X-code. But I can drag out towards the bottom here,

89
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,915
this guy, View, which is a generic UI view.

90
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,051
So I drag him out here and his class or

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,055
his type is just UI view. I'm going to make my background

92
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,259
a different color so we can see him a little better there.

93
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,862
So I'm just gonna select my background and change it to,

94
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,097
oop, orange, I love orange, there's orange.

95
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,532
San Francisco Giants colors right there.

96
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,002
So here's my kind of generic UI view.

97
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,471
And I don't want this to be a generic UI view,

98
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,640
I want it to be a playing card view, okay, cuz that's what

99
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,976
I've been working on. And the way we do that is

100
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,945
with the different inspector on the right.

101
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,414
You see we've been using this inspector right here,

102
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,384
the attributes inspector. Right next door to it is this

103
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,720
guy. This is the identity inspector,

104
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,623
it inspects the identity of the selected thing.

105
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,393
So here I have a view selected and it's of type UI view,

106
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:32,230
you see the class? But I can go here and change it to be

107
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:36,067
a playing card view. So now this is a playing card view,

108
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,904
and any time the system needs to draw it, it's gonna use our

109
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:44,676
draw(rect) right here. It's a code that we've written.

110
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,845
So that's awesome. Now I'm gonna do a little bit of auto

111
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,915
layout here that you've seen before. So this is nothing

112
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,985
new, but I'm just gonna put this up in the edge here,

113
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,955
put this one down here and I'm gonna pin it to the edges.

114
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,057
So my PlayingCard is gonna be kind of tall and

115
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,229
thin in portrait mode and kind of short and wide in landscape

116
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,865
mode, but that's okay, we'll fix that later. So

117
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,868
I'm just gonna drag up to the corner and set my leading and

118
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,272
top spaces to be pinned. And I'm gonna drag Ctrl+drag down

119
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,975
to this corner and set my trailing and bottom.

120
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,544
So they'd start there, so now if I go and

121
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,914
go into landscape mode right here, you can see that it

122
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,251
pins to the edges, so I have this funny shape. Now,

123
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,654
I'm doing this mostly at the start here because I want to

124
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,424
show what happens inside your view when your bounds change.

125
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,527
Because here when we rotate, our bounds are gonna be

126
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,065
changing very dramatically, from tall and thin to wide and

127
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,800
short. So before we dive into doing a playing card,

128
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,969
I'm just gonna do a little bit of drawing,

129
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,472
show you how drawing works with core graphics and

130
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,041
UI bezier path like we talked about in lecture. So

131
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,344
lets first draw a circle, just a circle in the middle of our

132
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,281
view using core graphics, and see what that code looks like.

133
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,318
So in core graphics, we always get the context first.

134
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,855
So we can't draw in core graphics without a context and

135
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,391
we get that in our drawrect by doing this

136
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,562
UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext. Now, this could return nil,

137
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,031
that's why we do if-let, but it will never return nil

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,567
inside your drawrect. Okay, it might turn,

139
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,170
return nil in other contexts, but in this environment,

140
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,471
it's always gonna return,

141
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,040
but we're still gonna do if-let right there. We could

142
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,576
do exclamation point where we're just gonna do if-let.

143
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,447
So now that I have a context, now I can tell the context to

144
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:33,184
do certain things, move to, okay, I can do move to.

145
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,422
I can do add line to, things like that. Add curve,

146
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:40,625
I can add these things that basically are drawing a path,

147
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,461
right, like a line moving around. So I'm gonna

148
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,565
make a circle. So I'm gonna use one called addArc.

149
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,670
An addArc is kinda cool, it just like takes a point and

150
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,240
then circumscribes a big arc around a circle.

151
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,876
And I'm just gonna use that to go all the way around and

152
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,079
create a circle. So when addArc is creating a path,

153
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,581
it wants to know what's the center of this circular

154
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,982
path that you're going on.

155
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,286
And I'm gonna make it be the center of my drawing area. And

156
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,924
what rectangle specifies my drawing area? Bounds, okay, my

157
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,460
var bounds does that. So I'm gonna create a CGPoint here,

158
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,531
which, whose x coordinate is my bounds midpoint.

159
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,900
And I'm gonna create the y coordinate is my bounds

160
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,204
midpoint in y. So I'm specifying right in the center

161
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,240
of my drawing area, which is my bounds. The radius,

162
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,111
I'm just gonna do 100 points, nice big circle.

163
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,414
The start angle and end angle here are in radians,

164
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,452
not degrees, not 0 to 360, it's radians, 0 to 2 pi.

165
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,421
Does everyone know radian? If you know what radians are.

166
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,958
Okay, everybody, great, so 0 to 2 pi. And 0, by the way,

167
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,228
is off to the right. 0 is not straight up,

168
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,163
as you might imagine, it is off to the right.

169
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,664
So I'm gonna start off to the right and

170
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,233
I'm gonna go all the way around my circle.

171
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,867
I can go either clockwise or counterclockwise,

172
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,869
it doesn't matter cuz I'm going all the way around. So

173
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,406
how do I go around? Well, that's 2 times pi. And

174
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:06,477
there's a really nice, little constant here,

175
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,448
CGFloat.pi. Okay, and that's how I can get pi in a CG,

176
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,217
as a CGFloat. And I can go clockwise or

177
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,354
counterclockwise, it doesn't matter. All right, so

178
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,790
now I've created some path, some drawing here.

179
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,526
So I can do other things in my context like,

180
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,230
I can set the LineWidth, for example, not the LineCap, but

181
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,433
the LineWidth, 5 points wide. That's a reasonably thick,

182
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,136
not super thick, but reasonably. I, of course,

183
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,440
can set the colors I wanna draw with using these static

184
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,811
vars in UIColor. Like let's say, green for our setFill.

185
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,680
That's our favorite fill color. And UIColor.red for

186
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:47,018
our stroke color. Okay, so I can set whatever colors. And

187
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:52,524
then I can ask the context for example, to stroke the path.

188
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,928
So let's do strokePath here. And you'd think I could then

189
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:01,166
say context.fillPath. Let's see if this will stroke and

190
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,401
fill, and it won't. And the reason for that is that when

191
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,972
we draw in a context, it's actually slightly different

192
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,875
than using that UIBezierPath I showed you in the slides.

193
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,879
In the context, when we do a strokePath like this,

194
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,483
it consumes the path. Okay, it uses up the path. And so

195
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,153
when we do the fillPath on the next line, there's no path.

196
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,355
We'd have to start again. So

197
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,790
that's one of the big advantages of UIBezierPath. So

198
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,862
let's do this exact same thing here, but using UIBezierPath,

199
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:35,032
all right? So I'm gonna say let path = UIBezierPath.

200
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,400
We'll start with an empty one.

201
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,903
It had, I'll show you later how to create a BezierPath to

202
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,307
start with a path. And then I can do the exact same things,

203
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,776
almost exact same methods as above. In fact,

204
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,514
I'm gonna copy and paste this exact same code right here.

205
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,416
The names are slightly different, in UIBezierPath,

206
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,219
but they're doing exactly the same thing, like lineWidth.

207
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,520
You don't say setLineWidth,

208
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,692
it's just a var on that objects. So you set it to 5.0.

209
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,230
You still set your colors by doing this. And

210
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,668
here the difference, though, as I can say path.stroke.

211
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,204
And that path, that UIBezierPath,

212
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,808
still exists as an object, so I can say path.fill.

213
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,342
I could also move the path over or

214
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,611
shrink it down a little bit and stroke it again.

215
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,247
You see what I'm saying? So I can use this path that I built

216
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,584
this arc over and over and over. That's the whole point

217
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:31,022
of kind of building it in this struct here, or this class,

218
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,790
UIBezierPath. So we'll get rid of that.

219
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,726
And let's see what this does right here. And it's gonna be

220
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,030
very similar, but, of course, it's going to stroke and

221
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,101
fill that path. Oops, did I press play?

222
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,977
Okay, there it is, you see, stroked and filled there.

223
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,480
All right, now while we're here looking at a circle,

224
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,248
I'm gonna do something interesting.

225
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:01,286
I'm going to rotate this phone to landscape. And what shape

226
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,189
do you think we're gonna have here? Anyone wanna guess?

227
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,994
Unfortunately, not a circle. We want it to be a circle, but

228
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:15,400
it's an oval. So why did we get this? Because by default,

229
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,302
when you change the bounds of your view,

230
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,973
it just takes the bits and scales them to the new size.

231
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,542
Which sometimes that might be what you want, but

232
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,579
a lot of times, this is definitely not what you want,

233
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,083
right? So how do we stop this? Well, what we want it to do is

234
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:36,421
to call this code again when we change our bounds and

235
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,923
have us draw the circle again in the new space. So

236
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,893
how do we do that? Let's go back to our storyboard here,

237
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,231
take a look at our view. If we inspect our view, at the very

238
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,769
top of the inspector, the very first thing is Content Mode,

239
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,771
Scale To Fill, right?

240
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,508
So it scales the bits to fill when the bounds change. And

241
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:01,713
we want to change that to be Redraw. So Content Mode Redraw

242
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,316
means call my draw rect again when my bounds change. So

243
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:10,454
now when we run, we get to see our circle. And

244
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,558
when we rotate to landscape, i's going to redraw, and

245
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,360
thus, draw it as a circle, which is what I intend.

246
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,895
Tha's what our drawing code that does,

247
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,031
it draws a circle. So that's important to note,

248
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,200
especially in your homework. You're doing these set cards.

249
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,802
You got your squiggles, and your diamonds, and all that.

250
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,438
You, when, if your bounds were to change in a set card,

251
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,007
you wouldn't want it to like squish it into some other

252
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:35,012
shape. All right, so that is enough of kind of

253
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:39,049
taking a look at drawing with Core Graphics and with

254
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,921
UIBezierPath. Let's settle down now to drawing a card.

255
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:49,793
Now what are the parts of a card? We've got the corners,

256
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,130
right? The corners of the card, which is the rank and

257
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,932
the suit in the corners. In the middle, we've got either

258
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,801
a face card image of some sort or we've got a bunch of pips.

259
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,304
Those little things are called pips. The hearts and clubs and

260
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,940
diamonds, we got a bunch of pips in there. So that, that's

261
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,810
how we got to build our card. But actually, the card has

262
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,446
another thing, which is almost always has rounded edges,

263
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,948
right? You know, if you've ever played cards,

264
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,718
you don't want sharp edges cuz it catches on things and

265
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,753
stuff like that. So you want nice rounded edges. So

266
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,722
let's start by back, drawing the background of our card

267
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,725
as a rounded rect. Now you actually know how to do this

268
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,527
using the layer of a UI view,

269
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,197
which was in assignment two hints. But

270
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,667
I'm gonna draw it directly, using a UIBezierPath. So I'm

271
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:34,572
just gonna say here, let path, actually, or you can call it

272
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,443
a roundedRect cuz that's what I want, in my background,

273
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:43,180
= UIBezierPath. And I'm gonna use a different constructor

274
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,616
than I used before. And you see there's a lot of them,

275
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:50,555
ovals and rects, but here's one for roundedRect. So

276
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,523
I'm gonna get, do this roundedRect.

277
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,026
It's asking me where you want your roundedRect to fit into.

278
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,396
So I obviously want it in my bounds.

279
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,631
It's gonna fill my entire bounds.

280
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,034
And then this corner radius is how many points the radius of

281
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,072
the turn of the corners is. And for now I'm gonna set

282
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,176
that to a magic number. We don't really want blue,

283
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,713
which is these literals. We don't want these in our code.

284
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,449
These are bad and I'm gonna get rid of that pretty soon

285
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,552
here. Why do we not want those? Because if we actually,

286
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,422
literally have magic numbers like that, we wanna collect

287
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,024
them all into some area where we have our constants.

288
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,192
So we can modify them and

289
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,428
understand what we've chosen and all that.

290
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,863
We don't spread it all out through our codes.

291
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,365
If we're ever going to change the constants,

292
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,267
we're looking at a round, round form. But for now, we'll

293
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,837
leave it this way. All right, so I got my roundedRect.

294
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,540
The first thing I'm gonna do to my roundedRect actually is

295
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,144
I'm gonna tell it that I want it to be the clipping area for

296
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,148
all my drawing. So as I've had this nice roundedRect,

297
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,950
which is the edges of my card, I don't wanna draw outside

298
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,821
that roundedRect. By Rect, my drawing all has to be inside.

299
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,922
Now, I don't think I'm gonna write any code that goes

300
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,792
outside. But in your assignment three, you might.

301
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,894
Because in assignment three, you're gonna have to draw

302
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,964
the squiggle shape. With arcs and lines or something, and

303
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,800
then one of the fill modes is striping. So you're gonna have

304
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,102
to draw up stripes in there. Well, imagine trying to draw a

305
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,671
stripe that goes from one edge of a squiggle to another edge.

306
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,707
This would be almost impossible.

307
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,543
Much nicer if you just have your squigle be a path,

308
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,880
add it as the clip, now you can draw those lines sloppily,

309
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,783
like you're a two-year-old in a coloring book,

310
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,918
draw them paths. And it'll get clipped, so

311
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,287
it's all inside the squiggle. You see why you want clipping?

312
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,390
So here I don't care so much, but I just wanna show you what

313
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,727
it looks like to call that. Now, I want the my card to be

314
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:41,531
white of course, so I'm gonna say UIColor.white.setFill().

315
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,835
And then I'm going to fill my roundedRect. My roundedRect is

316
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,239
just a Bézier path, so I can say fill.

317
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,875
So let's and see. This worked, cuz now, hopefully,

318
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:57,314
we should have roundedRect for our card. And we don't.

319
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,685
See it still has sharp edges up here, see these sharp edges

320
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,487
right here? Why does that still have sharp edges?

321
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,590
Well, actually, this code worked perfectly. It drew

322
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:11,495
a perfect white rounded rect on a white background. So

323
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,831
we cannot see it, it's sitting there on a white background.

324
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,600
So we need to go back to our storyboard here,

325
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,537
and change this so that it's not white background. So

326
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,707
what color background do we want for this thing? Actually,

327
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:28,345
we want it to be clear. Because when we draw a rounded

328
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,948
rect, we wanna see through the parts of

329
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,517
the corners that is rounded, to whatever is in

330
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,586
the background. So we want it to be clear. But

331
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,855
as soon as we start talking about clear and

332
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:42,059
see-through in our view, we need to talk about

333
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,696
this switch right here, the is opaque switch.

334
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,734
And as I said in the lecture, this is by default on, and

335
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,968
it's assumed you don't have any see-through parts,

336
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,771
no transparency, and it can be more efficient when it draws.

337
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,674
So if we do use transparency, which is less efficient,

338
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,543
but we need it here,

339
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,511
because we need our corners to show through,

340
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,281
we have to turn this off. So don't forget to turn that off,

341
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,619
if you're gonna do anything transparent in your view.

342
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,289
All right, now we have rounded rect. You see the rounded

343
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,860
corners right there, and we have it in both landscape and

344
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,462
portrait, okay. So that's good. All right, we're off to

345
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,298
a good start. Now, we're gonna do our corners.

346
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:25,135
So our corners, remember, are rank and suit, and I'm going,

347
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,072
it actually will probably be easier to draw the corners

348
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,108
with an NSAttributedString, directly in my drawRect.

349
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,011
Probably could do it in five lines of code.

350
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,415
But instead, I'm gonna use 15 lines of code, and

351
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,983
do it with a UI label.

352
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,453
Because I wanna show you how you can build your UI view,

353
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:46,690
out of other views, by making them subviews of yours. Then

354
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,528
we'll do some other drawing with drawRect, which will also

355
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,697
be only a couple lines, all very efficient to do.

356
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,768
So how I'm gonna do this on my UI label, is I'm gonna create

357
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,438
a UI label that uses an attributed string as its text.

358
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:06,777
And this attributed string is going to look like this.

359
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,679
So if it's gonna have, for

360
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:12,249
let's say, let's pick five of hearts. So

361
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,853
I'm doing the five of hearts, and this is the corner of my

362
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,455
big card. So I'm just gonna create an attributed string,

363
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,592
which is five carriage return,

364
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,162
heart. That's the attributed string I'm gonna create. To

365
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:29,233
make this work, my attributed string needs two attributes.

366
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,268
Attributed strings have attributes, I only need two.

367
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,705
One is the size of the font. I wanna make the font big if my

368
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,008
card is big, small font if my card is small.

369
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,578
The other thing is this needs to be centered,

370
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,814
cuz I don't want this five over here, lined up with

371
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,884
the left edge of the heart. I want the five centered over

372
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,054
the heart, right? And I might have like a ten of hearts.

373
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,556
This ten might actually be wider than the heart. But

374
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,425
I want these two things centered. So

375
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,693
I'm gonna show you an attributed string,

376
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,130
how to do fonts, and how to do centering of your text. So

377
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,368
let's create a little kind of utility function.

378
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:08,239
Pretty generic function. I'm gonna call it,

379
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:12,876
it's gonna be private, I'm gonna call it

380
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:18,782
centeredattributedString. So what this function

381
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,119
is gonna do is it's gonna take a string and a font size, and

382
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,389
return an NSattributedstring that's centered with that font

383
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,025
size. So it's gonna take a string,

384
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,128
some string as the string that we're gonna do. In our case,

385
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,698
it's gonna be five carriage return heart, and it's gonna

386
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:39,036
take some font size. Font sizes are CGFloats of course,

387
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,907
all photo point numbers in drawing are CGFloat, and

388
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:47,011
it's gonna return an NSAattributedString. So

389
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,446
that's what this little function is gonna do.

390
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,716
Because we need that to draw this corner piece. Okay,

391
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,651
let's do the fonts first.

392
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,886
So I'm gonna create a font. And to do that,

393
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,523
I'm gonna use those preferred fonts. Because this card,

394
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,159
what's on the card, is kind of user information, so

395
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,929
I wanna use a preferred font, not like the system font or

396
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,264
anything. So I do that with UIFont,

397
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,835
static method, preferredFont(forTextStyle.

398
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:14,705
In the text style, I'm gonna use is .body, the body font,

399
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,874
because it's really not a caption or a footnote or

400
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,812
a headline, it's kind of body text. But I'm gonna scale it,

401
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,015
and luckily, you can just say withSize to a font, and

402
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,851
give it the fontSize you want,

403
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,287
which is this argument to my method. So this is great, so

404
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,389
I've created a preferred font, the body font, and

405
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,224
I've scaled it to the right size that I want.

406
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,093
I'm gonna have to figure out what that size is for my card.

407
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,530
But there's one big problem with this.

408
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,366
If someone goes on, let's go to the simulator here.

409
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,701
Where's my simulator? And

410
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,006
if I go over to Settings on my device, and I go to General,

411
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:53,277
Accessibility, Larger Text. Look, I have a little slider

412
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:57,180
that can change the size of the text in all my apps.

413
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,951
Well, all my apps won't include this app unless I deal

414
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,322
with the fact that I fixed the font size here. So what I

415
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,291
really want, is something that's this font size, but

416
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,861
if they put that slider up, I want it to be bigger and

417
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,796
if they put that slider down, I want it to be smaller.

418
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,766
Luckily, there's a great way to do that, which is you can

419
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,235
just reset the font to be equal UIFontMetrics.

420
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:22,573
So this UIFontMetrics has a great feature in it, where you

421
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,276
can create font metrics for a certain text style.

422
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,946
Again, the body font right there. And

423
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:33,450
then you can get a scaled font from another font. So

424
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,386
you just give it a font, this one up here that I created,

425
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:40,357
and it will scale it based on that little slider. So

426
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,360
don't forget this line of code. Otherwise, users

427
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,163
who are visually impaired, or even just old guys like me,

428
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:49,033
who, you know, need big fonts, we set that a little higher,

429
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,036
and your app is not gonna do it. Your cards,

430
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,371
your playing cards, are gonna still have small text, so

431
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,775
don't forget this line, if you're doing fonts.

432
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,143
All right, how about the centering,

433
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,710
I wanna center the five on top of the heart.

434
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,748
Well, we're gonna do that with another little type, which is

435
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:08,285
called paragraphStyle. And I'm gonna create

436
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:13,157
an NSMutableParagraphStyle. So paragraphStyle

437
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,125
encapsulates all the things about a paragraph,

438
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,428
like its alignment and things like that. And so I just set

439
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,998
whatever I want in there. Like in this case, I want

440
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,667
the alignment to be set and I'm gonna set it to center. So

441
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,238
that makes the whole paragraph of text there be centered

442
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:30,875
horizontally. So that's it. Now, I can just return

443
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,110
an NSAttributedString with those attributes,

444
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,547
and I'm good to go. So let's use the same

445
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:42,052
exact initializer we used before. So here's the string.

446
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,521
That's the argument to the function right here, string.

447
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,089
And then the attributes right here,

448
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,991
I'm just gonna put the dictionary right in.

449
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,627
I'm not gonna put it in another bar or

450
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,464
anything like that. Let's just put it in. And so I

451
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,770
do NSAttributedStringKey .paragraphStyle for

452
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,907
example. So that's one of the keys, and the value is this

453
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,411
paragraphStyle I just created, and then I can also do .font

454
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,480
of fonts. Notice, I don't have to type this every time.

455
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,316
In fact, I don't even have to type it the first time,

456
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:18,254
because Swift knows what type of argument this thing takes.

457
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:23,193
So, it automatically will infer that part of this. So

458
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:26,930
that's it. Okay, nice reusable function that will create this

459
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,032
kind of attributed strength. So

460
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:33,403
now I'm gonna create a little private var, which I'm gonna

461
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:38,308
call cornerString. String,

462
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,245
and it's just gonna return a centeredAttributedString with

463
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,716
this, the five over the heart. So somehow I need to have my

464
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:51,622
rank plus a carriage return, +suit, and then I'm gonna,

465
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:55,792
woah, then I'm going to need, some font size.

466
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,160
Who knows what that's gonna be?

467
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,596
Well I have to talk about that,

468
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,898
because its got that font size. It's gonna depend

469
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,702
on how big my card is. My card is big, that's gonna be big.

470
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,537
So we have a couple of things to deal with here. One,

471
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,441
we need the rank and suit. So the playing card has to have

472
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,577
some way to set the rank and suit. Now, I'm gonna make my

473
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,648
rank be an int, and I'm gonna make my suit be a string.

474
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,885
Now this is different than the model we had.

475
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:25,088
The model had rank and string be enums, remember that?

476
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,124
But who cares? This is a view, it knows nothing about that

477
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,862
model. This is a generic card drawing view.

478
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,498
It does knows nothing of that particular model. So

479
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,333
the fact that it represents its rank and

480
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,703
suit in a completely different way, perfectly fine.

481
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,140
Whose job is it to translate between model and view?

482
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,709
Of course, the controller. So yo're, w're gonna see code

483
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,845
in our controller that translates between the models,

484
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,382
thought of what a rank and suit is in this view.

485
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,450
I also, I don't wanna have to

486
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,686
be an initializer there, it's used as no initializer. So

487
00:25:55,754 --> 00:26:01,458
let's start, let's start with this 5, 5 of Hearts.

488
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:07,263
Let me go grab a heart from, over here. Here's heart,

489
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,300
copy. All right. So we got 5 of hearts right there. And

490
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,969
there's one other thing too, which is, is this card face

491
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,341
up or face down? So I need a, isfaceup. She's a bull, and

492
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,544
we'll start with a face up, let's say. Now,

493
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:25,015
when you have vars like this in a view that affect the way

494
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:29,686
the view would draw, you have to think about the fact that

495
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:35,025
if this changes the rank, Your view needs to redraw itself,

496
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,929
right? If you change the rank, you gotta redraw. So

497
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:43,633
how do you do that? This is a really great use for didSet.

498
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,669
So when this rank changes,

499
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,407
someone sets the rank to 11, for a Jack, we gotta redraw.

500
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,976
And how do we make ourselves redraw? Everyone, remember?

501
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:58,248
setNeedsDisplay.

502
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,317
So that's gonna cause our drawRect to be called,

503
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:03,119
eventually. So we can't call our drawRect directly. We just

504
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:07,257
have to tell the system, hey, we need to be displayed.

505
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,227
Our view has another little thing that needs to happen.

506
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,297
We have subviews to drop part of our view, so

507
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,132
we need to have those subviews laid out.

508
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,670
Now, we're not using Auto Layout in our subviews,

509
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,640
we're putting them where they belong in the corners, but

510
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:27,310
we still need to say setNeedsLayout as well. So

511
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,478
that our subviews get laid out.

512
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,081
Now you don't have to say this if you don't have any subviews

513
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,516
that need laying out, or

514
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,418
that aren't affected by the rank changing. In our case,

515
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,721
it definitely does change the rank. So

516
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,958
we're gonna do that for all of our little public vars here,

517
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,460
because if people change any of these things,

518
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,195
it's gonna change the way our card looks.

519
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,700
Don't forget this piece right here, always gonna want that,

520
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,802
either one of these two, or both, on every time you have

521
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:56,306
a public var, that someone can change the look of your card.

522
00:27:57,443 --> 00:28:00,677
Okay, so now, we have rank and suit.

523
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:04,581
Unfortunately, rank is in int, so I can't say rank +suit. And

524
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,250
then also, I have this problem with this magic number here,

525
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,785
somehow I have to pick a font size.

526
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,554
So in order to speed this demo up a little bit,

527
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:16,359
I actually have a little extension to my playing cards.

528
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,763
Oops, there it is, this little extension right here.

529
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,732
This is the entirety of it, it's not very big. And

530
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,769
this has captured all of my little blue numbers,

531
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:31,508
my magic numbers, into a struct as static lets.

532
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:36,813
So this is how we do constants in Swift.

533
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,717
We make a private struct, we give it a name, sometimes it

534
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,653
might be called constants. I've called it SizeRatio,

535
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,623
because all of my constants are about the ratio

536
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:50,026
of the corner, or of a font, to the size of my card.

537
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,828
So I call this SizeRatio.

538
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,998
And then in here, I have the cornerFontSizeToBoundsHeight,

539
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,133
I have the cornerRadiusToBoundsHeight,

540
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,036
I have the cornerOffsetToCornerRadius,

541
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,904
I have the faceCardImageSizeToBoundsSize.

542
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,341
These are all ratios that I've picked, that I think will

543
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,943
look good. Then I even created some little computed

544
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,146
properties like cornerRadius, which takes the height, and

545
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:14,117
multiplies it by the ratio. So here's what it looks like to

546
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,887
use a constant that's declared like this, SizeRatio.whatever,

547
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,558
or if you have a constants, it might be constants.whatever.

548
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:25,328
You see how this kinda looks nice right there.

549
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:25,928
That's how we do it.

550
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,063
So I have these 3 things,

551
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,966
cornerRadius, cornerOffset, and cornerFontSize which would

552
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,602
have allowed me to get rid of blue numbers.

553
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,438
Instead, use something that's with respect to the size of my

554
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,775
cards' height. I also threw this whole guy in here,

555
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,379
rankString is just a var that turns 1 into A and 11 into

556
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,849
J and 12 into Q, and all the other ones into a number. So

557
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,952
that I can have a string that allows me to go up here when

558
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:52,189
I'm creating this little string right here. Instead of

559
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,358
saying rank plus character term plus suit, I'm gonna say,

560
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,660
rank string plus character term plus suit.

561
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,797
This, this is the, this means character return, right?

562
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,598
Go to the next line. And so now,

563
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,504
my font size can be this cornerFontSize, one of these,

564
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:12,141
once I created down here. And similarly, my cornerRadius

565
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,313
right here which was 16 can now be cornerRadius.

566
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,549
That's another one of these that I created. So see

567
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:23,153
how I've segregated off all of my constants into this nice,

568
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,821
little I even used some extension.

569
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,523
It wouldn't have to be an extension, but

570
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:29,325
I just put it off in its own space. And while I was at it,

571
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,162
by the way, I also added some extensions to CGRect and

572
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,331
CGPoint like zooming a rect, or sizing into something, Or

573
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,802
getting the left half of a rect, just for convenience.

574
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,770
It's gonna make my code look a little cleaner.

575
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,205
And you already know about how to do that.

576
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:43,940
We did that with the art for a random and int,

577
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,744
stuff like that. Okay, so we're getting very close to

578
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,346
making this work right now. All we really need to do is

579
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,717
create these UILabels. So I'm gonna create a var for them,

580
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:56,786
private var. I'm gonna have an upperLeft,

581
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,222
upperLeftCornerLabel, okay,

582
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,126
which is gonna be typed UILabel. And then,

583
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:08,732
I'm gonna have a lowerRightCornerLabel

584
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:13,336
to UILabel. Now, I need to create this UILabel,

585
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:17,174
so I'm gonna create a little function to do that,

586
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,677
private func createCornerLabel, and it's

587
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:24,081
just gonna return a UILabel. This is gonna be really easy.

588
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:27,717
I'm just gonna create a UILabel and return it, but

589
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,254
I have to do a little bit of configuration of this.

590
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,291
We'll get to that in a second. So here, instead of this

591
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,795
declaring this label, I'm gonna say =createCornerLabel.

592
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:42,632
And then here, createCornerLabel, oops,

593
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:47,003
not Repl_host, how about createCornerLabel.

594
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,173
All right, now, this is going to Once it catches up to me

595
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,676
and compiles, gonna create this error.

596
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,545
What is this error right here? Cannot use instance member

597
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,316
'createCornerLabel' Label within a property initializer.

598
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,319
Well, of course, I'm initializing a property here,

599
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,823
and here, I'm trying to call a method on myself. And

600
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,125
we know that until we're fully initialized,

601
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,128
we cannot call methods on ourself. So with this,

602
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,998
this is the old catch 22. So anyone wanna say how we could

603
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:20,036
fix this? Okay. Lazy. Good job, everybody. All right.

604
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,872
Lazy, exactly. So lazy makes it, so

605
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,708
these things won't be initialized until they

606
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,660
which will be after the thing is fully initialized. So,

607
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,545
are asked for,

608
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,681
this is equals. All right, so we have this UILabel.

609
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,950
What do we have to do to initialize our label? Really

610
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:38,387
only a couple things. One is I need to set this bar on label,

611
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,624
which is number of lines, because the default is one.

612
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,228
By default, a UILabel has one line. So if I have a two line

613
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:49,065
thing, like five\n hearts, it would only see the five.

614
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,402
The heart would not be shown. So I'm gonna change this to 0.

615
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,604
I could change this to 2, but I'm going to change it to 0.

616
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,841
What 0 means is use as many lines as you need, Mr.

617
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,444
Label. So I'm taking it to 0. So that's really the only

618
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,648
thing I have to say. The only other thing I have to do with

619
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,584
this label is add it as a Subview of myself.

620
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,788
If I dont add it as a Subview, then it won't be there,

621
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,223
it will never draw. Okay? So I have to add it as a Subview.

622
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,993
So that's all you need to do to create a CornerLabel.

623
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:20,663
But, I need to position these labels.

624
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,098
I have to put them in the right place, right? So

625
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,667
I should put one in the upper left and one down in the lower

626
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,638
right. So, where do I do that in my code? Well,

627
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:32,742
I have to do that every single time my bounds changes,

628
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,011
especially for the one in the lower right. Okay.

629
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,447
The one in the upper left is actually near my origin.

630
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,450
It's probably gonna be right no matter what my bounds are.

631
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,485
But the one in the lower left, in landscape,

632
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:45,221
it's way over to the right and not down very far, and then in

633
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,924
portrait, it's way down and only a little bit across,

634
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,526
right? So that one in the lower right is moving all over

635
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,395
the place when our bounds change like that,

636
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,230
when we rotate or any reason for

637
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,900
reason our bounds would change. So where can we put

638
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,703
some code that does something when our bounds change?

639
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,775
That's what this method, layoutSubviews is for.

640
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,111
To UIView method, make sure you call super,

641
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,881
because UIView is awesome at laying out Subviews.

642
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,452
It uses auto layout. All that auto layout stuff we're doing,

643
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,288
that's all stuff that UIview knows how to layout

644
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,558
your Subviews. Now, these two Subviews,

645
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,693
I'm not doing any control dragging. In fact,

646
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,296
I'm creating them in code, right? I created the UILabel

647
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:30,433
in code right here. So, I have to do the layout myself, and

648
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,869
layoutSubviews is where you do it.

649
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,838
Anytime your Subviews need to be laid out for any reasons,

650
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,875
this is going to get called by the system. You don't call it.

651
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:43,179
If you want it called, you call setNeedsLayout.

652
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,249
And setNeedsLayout, the system will eventually call this.

653
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,651
Just like if you do setNeedsDisplay,

654
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,254
the system will eventually call this. Okay?

655
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:54,057
Very, very similar. All right, so we now layoutSubviews.

656
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:58,394
All we gotta do is move this UILabel, this upper left, and

657
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,064
lower right labels, move them to the right spot. So let's do

658
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,666
the upper left, that's a really easy one, actually.

659
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:07,604
So I'm just gonna set my upperLeftCornerLabel.frame.

660
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:11,240
Remember, frame, in a UIView, is what positions it,

661
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,343
bounds is where we draw, frame sets it. So

662
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,848
I'm gonna set its origin basically equal to my origin,

663
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:24,821
but offsetBy, so I added this little offsetBy in CGPoint.

664
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,390
It just moves the point over by some amount,

665
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,893
offsets it. So I'm gonna offset it by this

666
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,396
cornerOffset that I have. So the cornerOffset,

667
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,634
which is one of these things I made from my constants here,

668
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,570
that just gets passed the little curve.

669
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,274
I don't wanna draw this with the curve right here, so

670
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,977
I need to move it in a little bit from the roundedRect.

671
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,846
Okay? So that's it. Now, we're not quite there.

672
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,783
We've positioned it, but we haven't actually set

673
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:57,988
this string on it. So I'm gonna create another little

674
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:01,658
function here I'm gonna call configureCornerLabel,

675
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:06,062
and I'm gonna pass that upperLeftCornerLabel to it.

676
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,167
And inside here, it's a little private func. We will pass

677
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:15,538
this label. We don't really need an external name, because

678
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,708
the name of the function implies the external name,

679
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:24,580
it's UILabel. So here, I'm gonna configure it.

680
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,415
And I don't actually have to do very much to configure it.

681
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:31,287
One thing I for sure need to do to this label is set it

682
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,925
attributedText to be my cornerString. Remember,

683
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,261
cornerString is this thing up here.

684
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,397
This little guy just gets a centeredAttributedString with

685
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,632
the rankStrin\n suit of the right size,

686
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,401
depending on how big our card is.

687
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,404
So we definitely need to do that.

688
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,506
What else might I need to do to my label when I do this?

689
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,042
Well, one thing is I want the label to be the right size.

690
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:57,146
Okay? I want it to be kind of the perfect size to enclose

691
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:03,586
this thing. Luckily, label has a method called sizeToFit, and

692
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:08,791
it will size the label to fit its contents. The only tricky

693
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,861
thing about this though, is if that label already has some

694
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,164
width, and you say sizeToFit, it will make it taller and

695
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,634
keep the width. Well, we don't want that.

696
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,402
We wanted to do the whole thing, so I'm gonna say,

697
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:27,009
label.frame.size = CGsize.0.

698
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,447
So I'm gonna clear out its size before I do sizeToFit.

699
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,983
That way, it will expand in both directions, across and

700
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:36,752
down. That's a little old trick about sizeToFit you

701
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:42,758
gotta know there. And the last thing, really tricky thing,

702
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,496
is what about if we are not face up?

703
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,899
Do we draw these corners not face up? Of course not.

704
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,702
We don't want the back of the card to have that. That would

705
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,171
make it really easy to play a lot of games if the back of

706
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,574
the card had corners on it. We don't want that,

707
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,577
so I'm going to configure the label to be hidden,

708
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:07,817
not highlighted. Hidden, if we're not face up.

709
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,586
Okay? So if we're face down, then I'm gonna be hidden.

710
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,288
So here's the example of using Hidden.

711
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,791
It keeps it in the Subviews, list, in everything,

712
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,760
keeps it in the right position, just hides it. Okay?

713
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,595
Instead, we're gonna draw the back of our card,

714
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,665
whatever that looks like. Okay. It's a good example

715
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,469
using isHidden right there. Okay. It should work.

716
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,204
Let's take a look and see if we can get that upper,

717
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:34,243
at least this upper left one to draw. There it is.

718
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,846
Five of hearts. It looks good. Let's see if it works when we

719
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,049
go to landscape. Whoa! Not only it's right position, but

720
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,186
look, it's smaller because the card is shorter, so

721
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:47,490
we don't wanna use half the card with our big font.

722
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,694
So that's good. What about the other corner? Okay,

723
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,430
well the other corner is a little harder to position

724
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,433
because our origin's in the upper left and

725
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,835
we're trying to put away down to the lower right.

726
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,670
But it's not that bad, so let's just try and

727
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:04,473
do it. This is our lowerRightCornerLabel. It's

728
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,578
frame.origin. Well, I'm gonna build this incrementally. I'm

729
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:13,249
gonna start by making a point, which is my bounds.maxX, so

730
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,520
all the way over to the right, and y is my bounds.maxY,

731
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:21,324
that's all the way down to the bottom. Okay? But

732
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,993
I can't put it there. If I try to put it there, here let's

733
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:29,131
draw a little picture so you can see. I'm drawing the lower

734
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,902
edge now. Okay, here's my lower edge of my card and

735
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,639
I'm trying to put this thing here. So I can't put it here.

736
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,142
If I put it where this is, this would be the origin,

737
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,245
it would be down here, not even on the card. So I need to

738
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:46,449
move this point first inside the corner offset, then,

739
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:50,320
the whole distance of the width and height of this

740
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,555
little thing, so I need to kinda make a double jump here

741
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,726
to get this origin up here, so this will draw there. Okay, so

742
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,727
I'm just gonna do double offset by.

743
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:03,399
The first offset by I'm gonna do is -cornerOffset and

744
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:08,438
-cornerOffset that gets me pass the roundedRect.

745
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:12,141
Then I'm gonna offset again

746
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,980
-lowerRightCornerLabel.frame.- size.width,

747
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,749
and -lowerRightCornerlabel.frame.-

748
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:25,187
size.height. You see how I had to move the origin

749
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,723
back up there, everybody cool with that. Okay, so

750
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,561
that positions it, this is wrong, cornerOffset, right?

751
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,498
So that position is it, of course we have to configure it

752
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,701
as well. So let's just do the exact same thing here but

753
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,037
we're gonna configure our lower right. Because it needs

754
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,774
to be configured in exact same way. And use the corner string

755
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:50,647
whatever, so, let's see what it looks like. Lower right,

756
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:55,852
oops. I didn't finish there lowerRightCornerLabel,

757
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:05,295
all right Okay, whoa interesting.

758
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,597
Well that's not quite right is it?

759
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:12,268
Okay, it's in the right spot but that five hearts

760
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:16,038
should be upside down, right? If you look at a card,

761
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,842
a playing card that would be upside down, okay.

762
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,012
So, how the heck am I gonna turn that thing upside down.

763
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,514
Well, that turns out to be super easy

764
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:30,019
in iOS because every view has a var on it,

765
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:35,591
lowerRightCornerLabel has a var and it called transform.

766
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,428
And transform is what's called an affine transform,

767
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,864
how many people know what an affine transform is? Okay,

768
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,199
nobody, basically, almost.

769
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:45,234
So an affine transform is really simple,

770
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:49,772
it's just a blob, a thing that represents a scale,

771
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,542
a translation, and a rotation. Okay, just those three things.

772
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:57,146
So you can take a UI view and rotate it, scale it, and

773
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,816
translate it all you want with just this one little var. Now

774
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,885
of course we are positioning things with the frame and

775
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,721
stuff like that, but this is an additional way to control

776
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,690
it's positioning, scaling, and rotation.

777
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,627
Now this is all going to be bit wise translation. So

778
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,763
it's going to be translating the bits. So if you make it

779
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:18,267
bigger, it might look kind of jaggy, edged, pixellated.

780
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:21,037
But we're not going to make it bigger. Instead, we just want

781
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:25,574
to rotate it. So you might think we can just do this.

782
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,745
Let's take the AffineTransform.identity

783
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,881
transform, so that means unrotated, unscaled,

784
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,816
untranslated, just an identity. And

785
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,785
you think I could just say rotate it.

786
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,953
By the way, transform only has three methods.

787
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,890
Rotate, transform, and scale, that's all it's got. So,

788
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,793
if I created a rotated one, how much would I want to

789
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:47,296
rotate this if I wanted to turn it upside down? Okay,

790
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:51,233
in radians? Pi, right? Cuz I want to turn,

791
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,770
turn half way around okay, so it's upside down. So I could

792
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:59,641
just say CGFloat.pi, but this would not actually work.

793
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,311
This is close but doesn't work so let me show you why that's

794
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,681
not gonna quite work. So if this paper here would do this.

795
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,952
Okay, so here's my corner right here and here's where

796
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,357
this five hearts thing is right now. It's, right side up

797
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,293
like this. Actually here we'll do on a piece of paper. So

798
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:21,497
here's my five of hearts. And I want it to be

799
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:25,601
upside down like this, right? Okay, that's what I want.

800
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,939
But, if I rotate it, it rotates around the origin. And

801
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:33,909
our origin's upper left. So if I rotate it, Pi, whoa,

802
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:38,014
it's gonna be up there. You see the problem? So

803
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,249
it will be upside down but not in the right place.

804
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,052
So I need to both rotate it and translate it. So

805
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,022
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna translate it first down to

806
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,993
here to its other corner then I'm gonna rotate it. Woho,

807
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,261
it's gonna work.

808
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:56,932
Okays So let's do that. Where are we, where is my rotator?

809
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,867
Here's the rotator so I'm going to keep that rotated.

810
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:05,274
I still want to do .rotated but I want

811
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,611
to do a translate first so I'm going to stay .translated

812
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,413
by and how much do I want to translate by? I want to

813
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:16,219
translate by the whole width and height of my lower right.

814
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:23,226
lowerRightCornerLabel.frame.s- ize.width and

815
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:28,764
the lowerRightCornerLabel.frame.s-

816
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,935
ize.height. So I'm taking the identity, I'm translating it

817
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:37,840
down to the corner, then I'm rotating it. I could also

818
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,843
have kinda translated it to the center and rotate it and

819
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:43,946
then move back. That's another way commonly to do

820
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,983
that rotation. But here we go, it's upside down and

821
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:51,854
it works, even in other bounced sizes. Okay,

822
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,456
excellent, so we've used the subview. We've used layout

823
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,992
subviews to make it always be in the right position,

824
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,929
all is looking well. Let's go check and

825
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,433
make sure that our slider,

826
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:08,004
remember this slider over here in settings. Remember we can

827
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,872
set it larger, let's go make sure this is working.

828
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:13,809
I'm going to set this to quite a large size font. And

829
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,345
hopefully when I go back to my app,

830
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:21,049
it should have a large font but it doesn't.

831
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,187
Why doesn't it have a large font? That is weird.

832
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:28,090
Well actually, it does, it's just it never redrew.

833
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,994
If I change my bounce, and flip back,

834
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:36,064
now I get see the large font. So that's a problem.

835
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:40,903
When that slider moves we need to find out that it moved. And

836
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,672
you can do that in view with a function called

837
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:48,143
TraitCollectionDidChange. So

838
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,146
traits, we're gonna talk about traits in a couple of weeks.

839
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:55,284
Traits have a lot to do with are you rotate, are you

840
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,820
landscape, are you portrait, things like that are traits.

841
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,557
But also, your size category in general for your font. So

842
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,526
trait collection gets called whenever those things change.

843
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,565
Here, I'm just going to setNeedsDisplay and

844
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:13,368
setNeedsLayout, okay. So with my traits,

845
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,139
the thing that control how we draw change,

846
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:20,709
then I'm gonna redraw. So now if we go back,

847
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,911
right now our fonts are big if we set them big,

848
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,514
so they're gonna start out big. And after I go back and

849
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:30,085
set them to be small over here in my settings,

850
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:35,657
go back to normal size, oops, sorry. I'm gonna, got that,

851
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:41,330
what? There we go, so set it back to normal. Just go here,

852
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,799
go back to our playing card and it rejoint normal.

853
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:47,636
Okay, because it found out that that slider had moved. So

854
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,972
minor little thing you've got to remember to do this and

855
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:54,610
we'll talk a lot more about traits down the road. Let's go

856
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:58,414
back, and do a little bit of layout stuff, take a little

857
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,150
break from drawing our card, and do layout. So right now,

858
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,754
we've got this thing where this card takes up the whole

859
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,556
space, actually, I'm gonna make the card wide again so we

860
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,858
can see it a little better. So I'm just going back here and

861
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:15,330
make it wide, so this card is not really card-shaped.

862
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,734
Cards are not tall and thin like that and they certainly,

863
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:23,105
cards are definitely not like this card over here,

864
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,874
no cards look like that. That's ridiculous,

865
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,545
we don't want that. We want it to look more like a card, and

866
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,346
what makes a card look like a card? Well,

867
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:35,450
it's its aspect ratio. Right, the width, the relationship of

868
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,954
the width to the height, so we want to change that. So to do

869
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,757
that we can't have the edges pinned to the edges anymore.

870
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,462
So let's take our constraints to the pin it to the edges and

871
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,631
instead of making them pinned let's make them be greater

872
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,468
than or equal so that we, our card doesn't go off the edges

873
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,538
but it's not pinned to the edges either. So

874
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,974
how do we do that easily, or you can find out all

875
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,344
the constraints that are on a view by just selecting it and

876
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,547
going to this other inspector on the other side of your

877
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:09,151
attributes inspector, called the size inspector.

878
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,388
See here's my constraints, these are my four constraints.

879
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:15,658
So even as I mouse over them, look, they highlight.

880
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,160
So, right now they're all equals, they're pinned.

881
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,430
Okay, equal sixteen, pinned to the edge, equal sixteen.

882
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,532
You can change that equals just by editing them and

883
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:24,800
changing it to greater than.

884
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,769
We actually did this last time and we can do that for

885
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,973
all of ours. Just let them all just be advisory.

886
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:34,310
And let's not do the bottom right up against the bottom,

887
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,513
let's go ahead and just do greater than or equal to. And

888
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,248
same thing here, greater than or equal to and we'll do 16.

889
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:43,219
So it's at least the same on all sides.

890
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,523
So now, these constraints on the edge are just advisory.

891
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:51,727
They're just saying make sure you don't go past 16 points

892
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:54,329
from the edge. So that's great. But now,

893
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:58,467
the lines are all red, you see how everything's turned red?

894
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:01,837
That's because we no longer specify where this card's

895
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:04,840
supposed to be anymore. Since we're not pinning it to

896
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:08,144
the edges, where it's supposed to be. Well, let's first fix

897
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:11,780
this aspect ratio problem. Okay, I want the card to

898
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:15,751
have an aspect ratio, you know, kinda like the ad or so.

899
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,988
Basically, five across to eight down seems to be typical

900
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,758
card ratio. And it turns out you can

901
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:26,295
fix the ratio of a view by doing control drag.

902
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:28,830
But you don't control drag to another view like we do when

903
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:33,101
we're pinning to the edge. You control drag to itself.

904
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,636
When you control back to itself,

905
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,506
you're offered the option of fixing the width, the height,

906
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,175
or the aspect ratio of this view. So I'm gonna fix

907
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:43,779
the aspect ratio. So now, I've added a constraint,look

908
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,415
at it over here, that fixes the aspect ratio.

909
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:50,519
Now of course, I don't want aspect ratio to be 259 to 461.

910
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:55,357
So I'm gonna edit to make it five to eight.

911
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:57,159
So I fixed this after that.

912
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,961
This still doesn't say anything about where the thing

913
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,565
is supposed to be or what size it's supposed to be or

914
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:05,267
anything like that. So let's put another constraint that

915
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,002
says it's gonna be right in the middle.

916
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,538
So you see how I used the dash blue lines to drop it

917
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,542
perfectly in the middle? Now I'm gonna control drag from

918
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,679
the card back to my outer view right here. And this time,

919
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,616
instead of doing trailing in top which I already have those

920
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,419
greater than or equal to ones, I'm gonna pick center,

921
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,756
horizontally, and vertically. And you notice this says,

922
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:30,025
horizontally and vertically in safe area. So

923
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:32,394
every view knows it's safe area.

924
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:36,632
It's safe area is the place it can draw without overriding or

925
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,835
impinging upon other views space. So for this

926
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,605
orange view, it's safe area does not include this place

927
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,942
where the facial recognition and the time of day.

928
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:48,577
All that up here, so it wouldn't draw up there.

929
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,746
It also does not include this little bar down here.

930
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,449
If there were bar buttons along the bottom or a title

931
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,286
across the top, it wouldn't include that either and

932
00:50:57,355 --> 00:51:00,656
that's all automatic and not only automatic, as it changes.

933
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,992
This constraints will automatically adjust to that.

934
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,560
So, if you put a title on the top of this view and

935
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,864
let's say very move down, then my card would move down to be

936
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,733
the center of the new safe area. So that's what safe

937
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:15,871
areas all about. We are always creating constraints between

938
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:20,041
view safe areas, all right? Okay, so now I've said where

939
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,579
it is but things are still red. Why are they still red?

940
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,314
Well, because I haven't said how big this view is.

941
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,784
I've said what it's aspect ratio is and where it is and

942
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:30,853
I've said that it can't go pass the edges but

943
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,889
I haven't said what size it is. A very small card would

944
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:37,359
satisfy all this constraints over here, right?

945
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,961
Very small card would be going out the edges. It could be

946
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,965
the right aspect of ratio, it could be the middle or larger

947
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,934
cards that doesn't go out to the edges, could fulfill all

948
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:50,005
these, all right? So, how do I tell the system, I want you to

949
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:53,775
be as big as possible and still satisfy this? Well,

950
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:57,979
I'm gonna do that by pinning. By dragging to myself,

951
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,416
my width. And I'm gonna set my width which is currently 259,

952
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,553
I'm gonna edit it. By the way, that fix the problem cuz now

953
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,022
look no red because I've set how high it is.

954
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:11,726
But I want it to be bigger. I'm gonna say I want it to be,

955
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:16,465
let's say 800 wide. Okay, now as soon as try to

956
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,467
have a constraint to say this is 800 wide.

957
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,672
Wow, we went red again. Now why are we red? We're red

958
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:27,075
now because these constraints can not be satisfied.

959
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,112
There is no way you can be 800 wide and also no

960
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,382
go off the edge. Basically, so that's the problem.

961
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,951
Now, how are we gonna fix this? Well all these

962
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,488
other constraints besides the width I got to have those.

963
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,123
If I don't have those edge constraints,

964
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,458
it could go off the edge, got to have it. Aspect ratio,

965
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,994
that's what I want card to look like, got to have it.

966
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,597
In the centre, I definitely want the card in the centre.

967
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,433
Width, well I wanted it to be 800 but

968
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,835
really I just wanted it to be big.

969
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,239
So, that 800 width is not as important to me,

970
00:52:57,308 --> 00:53:00,909
in other words, it's lower priority constraint.

971
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:03,478
So, I can tell the system that by going over here and

972
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,415
editing this constraint, and changing it's priority.

973
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,850
You see priority 1,000 right there?

974
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,621
That's is the max priority, that is required priority.

975
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:16,058
So, we can pick any priority less than a 1,000 cuz all of

976
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:18,793
these are at 1,000. And this will be less important.

977
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,630
So we'll still try to satisfy it as best we can.

978
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,466
But it won't override any of the other ones.

979
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,100
We do that by clicking on the priority.

980
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,636
We could type a number, or

981
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,972
we can pick some kind of well known ones,

982
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,641
like high priority. And whoa, look what happened.

983
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,111
All the red went away, it made the thing as big as it could.

984
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,247
It's still satisfying all the constraints.

985
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:41,783
It's doing that both here and over here.

986
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,753
See, it made it as big as it could and still have that

987
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,857
five to eight aspect ratio in the middle. So,

988
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:52,894
that's the magic of constraint priorities, okay. Making

989
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,830
constraints that don't matter as much have lower priority.

990
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,168
So we'll try to give you as much of them as it can but

991
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,237
it will give in on those lower priority ones.

992
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,441
Everybody cool with that? Okay, so now we got this thing

993
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:08,043
looking more like a card. It's got a card aspect ratio.

994
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:12,514
So let's turn it back to clear, here. And go back to

995
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,583
drawing it, because we still have only done the corners and

996
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,887
we need to do the rest. So let's next to do the face in

997
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:23,025
the middle and of a face card, we need some kind of image.

998
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,727
I'm going to do that by drawing an image,

999
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,930
and I just happen to have over here, somewhere,

1000
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,965
not this. This guy right here.

1001
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:34,836
Face cards, a bunch of face card images. Woohoo, okay.

1002
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:38,640
And I'm just gonna drag all these images into my project.

1003
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,142
Well, where do I put them? That's what this

1004
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:45,847
Assets.xeassets is for, the place where the icon was here.

1005
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,716
You can drag any images you want in here.

1006
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,052
So, I can go grab all of these images, drag them all in.

1007
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,156
Now when I do that, it looks like some of them didn't come

1008
00:54:54,225 --> 00:54:56,157
in, these ones that say @2x.

1009
00:54:56,226 --> 00:55:00,362
You see, @2x? No, those didn't drag in. Yes, they did.

1010
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,266
That @2x means it's the same as the one that doesn't have

1011
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,068
@2x, but it's twice the resolution.

1012
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,273
So it put them as a 2x version, twice resolution.

1013
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:15,510
Now, some devices have three x resolution, like iPhone plus

1014
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:18,880
for example. I don't have any cards in that resolution so

1015
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,383
it'll fall back to using the 2x resolution.

1016
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,721
But I probably should add 3x resolutions to all my cards.

1017
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,022
Now these jpegs that I dragged in,

1018
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,993
this is telling me the name of it. And it got it from

1019
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,428
the file name of the jpeg, but you can rename these to be

1020
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,329
whatever you want.

1021
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:38,533
I've conveniently named them Rank suit. Okay? So that I can

1022
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:43,539
find them. And putting these images in my face card is just

1023
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:47,376
a matter in my draw(rect) of looking these up by name. So

1024
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,311
let's go to our playing card view. Back to our draw rect

1025
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:56,184
where we draw our roundedRect here. Now we're gonna say if.

1026
00:55:56,253 --> 00:56:01,089
We can let the facecardimage =, better

1027
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:05,894
go wide here, = UIImage. So UIImage is a thing that

1028
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:09,331
represents an image, and if you look at its constructors,

1029
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:12,067
it has quite a few, but one of the ones it has is,

1030
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:16,137
named. And now you just specify the name, and this

1031
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,441
name has to match this name that's in xcassets over here.

1032
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,046
Okay, so that is our rank string,

1033
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,953
Plus our suit. Okay, so that is the name. So if we're able

1034
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,555
to find that then we must have found a face card.

1035
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,857
So now we're gonna just put that face card image.

1036
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:39,861
Draw it and we draw by saying .draw In and

1037
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,431
I'm gonna draw it in my bounds but actually I

1038
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,300
don't really wanna draw that face card in my full bounds,

1039
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,969
it might smash into the corners, right?

1040
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:50,271
So I'm going to take that bounds and

1041
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,975
zoom it down a little bit by one of my constants down here,

1042
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,877
this constant right here, so

1043
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:58,580
this is SizeRatio.FaceCardImageSizeR-

1044
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:02,517
atio and I currently have it set to be 75%. So I'm gonna

1045
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:06,655
have my face card be 75% of the full size right there.

1046
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,491
And that's it, that's all you need to do to draw images.

1047
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,326
Really easy to get them by name and

1048
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:14,296
then just draw them in some rectangle. So let's go change

1049
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:18,633
our card to be a face card, how about, let's say a Jack,

1050
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:22,904
11 is a Jack. Make sure this draws and

1051
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:26,241
it should be 75% of the size of card here.

1052
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:31,413
There it is, it is and when we rotate it draws it smaller.

1053
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,348
Cuz it's drawing it compared to our bounds,

1054
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,684
which our bounds are changing when we rotate. So

1055
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:40,021
that's super cool. What about pips? So what if we head

1056
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:43,858
back to having the rank B5, then in the middle we draw

1057
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:47,095
five hearts, five little hearts. Well, I'm not gonna

1058
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:50,632
waste our lecture time going through code that does that,

1059
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,100
because it's pretty straightforward code and

1060
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,234
you're not gonna learn anything new.

1061
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,502
You can certainly look at it offline,

1062
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,906
I'll be posting this code online. So

1063
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:01,543
I have it right here though, it's called drawPips. So

1064
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:03,244
there's this function drawPips.

1065
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:07,215
The way it works is data driven, so like for the five

1066
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,385
rows goes two pips, and then one pip in the middle, and

1067
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,921
then two pips at the bottom, right? Or an eight is two

1068
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,690
two two and two, etc, so it's just data driven. And

1069
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:18,193
it literally just does a for loop and goes through the for

1070
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:21,563
loop and draws either one pip or two pips and

1071
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:24,199
just goes down and draws however many rows there are.

1072
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,801
It does have this kinda cool little embedded func,

1073
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,238
you notice that functions can be inside functions in Swift.

1074
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:33,542
This createPipString just creates an attributed centered

1075
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,544
string, but it does't have the five. I's just the pip

1076
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,313
part of it, but i's still centered which is nice so

1077
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,115
it draws it in the center of the card. And it kinda picks

1078
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,885
the size by guessing what the right size would be and

1079
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,854
seeing how big that is and then adjusting it so

1080
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:48,423
that it picks the perfect size pip to fix,

1081
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:50,825
to fit the space that's available. So you can look and

1082
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:54,496
see how I do that using center attributed string there. Okay,

1083
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:58,366
that's pretty much it. So if it's not a face card, then we

1084
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:03,138
want to drawPips, so let's see if that works for our five.

1085
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:12,347
Looks pretty good and let's see, we'll rotate it, smaller,

1086
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:16,518
it all got smaller. So easy to do this stuff, right?

1087
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:20,955
Now we kinda are at a point with this thing,

1088
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:21,890
there was one other thing, sorry,

1089
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,926
we have to draw which is the back of our card, okay.

1090
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:27,595
So it really should only do this stuff if it's face up,

1091
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:31,332
all right. Should only do the face card in the pips if it's

1092
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,835
face up and we already made it so that if it's not face up,

1093
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,139
it hides our little labels, right?

1094
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:40,441
It is hidden, hides our labels so that's good. But if our

1095
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,312
card is face-down then we need to show the back of the card.

1096
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:46,114
So I'm gonna do that with an image as well.

1097
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:49,918
I'm gonna say if let cardBackImage = UIImage

1098
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:58,026
again, named, and I'm gonna call it cardback.

1099
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,327
So I'm gonna look for

1100
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,931
an image named cardback and if I can find it, then I'm gonna

1101
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,600
have draw in. And this time I'm gonna draw it in my entire

1102
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,602
bounds because it's not gonna hit any corners,

1103
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,405
the corners aren't there because I'm face down. So

1104
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,608
I need an image named cardback. So I'm gonna over

1105
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:16,545
here to assets and I have to put an image called cardback.

1106
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:19,081
So I'm gonna grab this image right here,

1107
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,950
it's my Stanford image. And I'm just gonna rename

1108
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,186
it right here to cardback, so this is my cardback.

1109
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,655
Notice it only has the lower resolution version there,

1110
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,290
it didn't have an add time 2X but

1111
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,261
I can drag higher resolution versions in to provide higher

1112
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,630
resolutions just like that. And this one is so

1113
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,666
high resolution, it's got a little tree in there even,

1114
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,568
okay and that's perfectly fine. No law that says it has

1115
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,104
to be just a scaled-up version of the same thing. So

1116
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,974
now I have cardback there, so now, let's go and make our

1117
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:52,113
card be face down by setting our isFaceUp here to be false.

1118
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:55,216
Okay, and run, and we'll see the back side of our card.

1119
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:56,751
And hopefully, we don't see any corners,

1120
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,287
we don't see any face, we don't see any pips. We won't

1121
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,790
see any of that stuff, we'll just have the back of our

1122
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,092
card. And this is a high resolution device so

1123
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,895
we got the 2X version. And you can see it's actually

1124
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,464
kinda jaggy, we really could use a 3X version here,

1125
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:14,436
it would be nice. Okay, now the next step if I were really

1126
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,905
developing this is I would want to go up here to my rank

1127
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:21,142
and suit and try every rank and every suit face up and

1128
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:22,911
face down, and make sure this all worked.

1129
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,547
Well, can you imagine if I had to do this. Okay, make a six

1130
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:30,117
and then a clubs and run. No, okay so it's seven and run.

1131
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,521
It would be tedious as all get out to be going back and

1132
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,024
forth running. What would be awesome is, so I can just see

1133
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:39,226
this playing card view right here in the interface builder.

1134
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,063
And of course, I can do that, I wouldn't have mentioned it.

1135
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,432
So let's go here, and how do you do that?

1136
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:50,371
You just put @IBdesignable in front of your view.

1137
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,572
If you put that in there,

1138
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,275
then when you go to interface builder,

1139
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:57,145
it will compile your view, put it in the environment and

1140
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:01,015
put it here. Now, it's blank, why is it blank? Well,

1141
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,618
it's actually blank because it's face down, and

1142
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:08,456
images don't work with image named in interface builder.

1143
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:11,025
For example, if I put this face up again,

1144
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,429
you'll see that it works with the pips, because they don't

1145
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:17,899
use any images. All right, go back to my storyboard.

1146
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:21,870
Look, I got pips, I got my corner things too. Okay, so

1147
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:24,772
it even does subviews. So what about those images?

1148
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:25,807
How am I gonna do the images,

1149
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,075
cuz that's problem not just for the card back, but

1150
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:32,513
if I make it be a a face card,

1151
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,649
the face card is made with images. And so

1152
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,851
I'm getting the corners, but I'm not getting my image.

1153
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,722
Well, it turns out there's another version of image named

1154
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:44,625
that you can use, that will work with both. So

1155
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,394
it will work image named when you run,

1156
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:50,298
but it will also work with image named when you are,

1157
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,269
when you're in interface builder environment.

1158
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,638
And it looks the same, I can never even remember it myself,

1159
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,909
so I had to write it down here. It's, in: Bundle

1160
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:07,348
(for: self.classForCoder),

1161
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:13,287
compatibleWith: traitCollection,

1162
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:17,691
okay. I think I typed that right. So this is the extra

1163
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,995
couple arguments you need, you put it on all your image names

1164
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:23,731
if you want this stuff to work in interface builder.

1165
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,867
So now if we go to Interface Builder, all right,

1166
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,403
it's showing the image. But this is only half the battle

1167
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,639
because, if I wanna look through all my cards and

1168
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:35,810
make sure they're working, I still have to go back here and

1169
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:39,113
change these ranks and suit and

1170
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,782
then go back and see it again. And what would be really cool

1171
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,719
is if I could bring up the inspector, click on my card,

1172
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:47,321
and instead of just seeing view attributes, if I could

1173
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,258
see rank and suit and his face up, wouldn't that be awesome.

1174
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,828
If I could just extend this The inspector, well,

1175
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:57,198
of course we can do that too. All we have to do is put

1176
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:01,269
@IBInspectable in front of any var that we want to

1177
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:05,507
be inspectable in Interface Builder. So I'm gonna put it

1178
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:09,077
on all my vars, I'll make them all be inspectable.

1179
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:13,681
The only trick here is that you have to explicitly type

1180
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:19,087
any IBInspectable, you cannot let this be inferred by Swift.

1181
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:22,590
Because while Swift is good at doing inference,

1182
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:26,828
Interface Builder not so much, not quite so good.

1183
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:29,030
All right, so here we go. Now if I click on my view,

1184
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:33,834
look at this, rank, I could try 5.

1185
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:38,739
I could try 12, all right? I can try 2,

1186
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:43,912
I can go even just go all through my cards, like this.

1187
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:48,583
And since I've represented my suit as a string,

1188
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:53,221
I could even have X be my suit right there.

1189
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:59,493
That works? Okay, so that's it for all the drawing stuff.

1190
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,630
Let's go back now and learn a little bit about multi-touch.

1191
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:07,668
So I'm gonna go back to our slides here. And we're running

1192
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,305
a little late, so I'm going to zoom through these. All right,

1193
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:13,941
so we've seen how to draw, now how do we get multi-touch?

1194
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,676
How do we get all these gestures and

1195
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,980
stuff people can make with their fingers on the screen?

1196
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,916
And you could get get all the touch events yourself,

1197
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:24,152
that's legal. You could, and look at them,

1198
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,619
look at every finger when it moves,

1199
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,489
but that'd be incredibly tedious, so we don't do that.

1200
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,492
Instead, we let iOS look at all those little movements and

1201
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:36,831
turn them into gestures, like swipe, pinch, pan,

1202
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:40,969
tap. So that's the level at which we program this stuff.

1203
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:43,905
Okay, now gestures all represented in iOS

1204
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,507
with this class UIGestureRecognizer.

1205
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:50,178
It's a thing that recognizes a gesture from all those finger

1206
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,281
movements. All right, that class is abstract, okay,

1207
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,250
it itself doesn't know how to recognize any gestures. But

1208
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,354
there's a lot of subclasses of it that know how to recognize

1209
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:03,224
various gestures. So when you're recognizing a gesture,

1210
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,394
there's actually two parts to it. One is, you have to tell

1211
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,364
a view, please start recognizing pinches,

1212
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:13,334
please start recognizing taps. Then you have to

1213
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:16,070
provide a handler so that when it does recognize it,

1214
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,973
it calls some function, so there's two parts.

1215
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:22,476
The first thing, asking a view to recognize a gesture,

1216
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,413
is surprisingly often done by the controller, or

1217
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,350
in your storyboard. That's how you add gestures, usually.

1218
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:32,153
Sometimes a view will add a gesture recognizer to itself,

1219
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,389
if it's just totally inherent to what it does.

1220
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,291
Like a scroll view will add pinching and

1221
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,626
panning gestures to itself,

1222
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:41,496
cuz it's not even a scroll view without those gestures.

1223
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,598
But a lot of times, it's the control that does it.

1224
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,533
The second thing, the handling of the gesture,

1225
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,936
if it something that affects the model,

1226
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,238
then the controller is going to handle it.

1227
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,441
If it's something that only affects the way things is

1228
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,546
viewed, then the view will often handle it directly. So

1229
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:01,615
we'll see examples of both of those in our little demo.

1230
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,986
So, the first part, how do you add a gesture to a view?

1231
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,555
How do you tell that view, start recognizing this?

1232
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:11,692
Well, usually we do this in the didSet of an outlet

1233
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:15,095
setter. So here I've got an outlet to some view that I

1234
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:18,933
want to recognize pans. Okay, it's some view, and I want it

1235
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:22,803
to recognize pan gestures. So in the didSet of the outlet,

1236
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:27,041
remember this didSet is called when iOS wires up that outlet

1237
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:29,944
to the view that you want to pan. Then I'm going to

1238
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:33,481
create a concrete instance of UIGestureRecognizer called

1239
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,117
a UIPanGestureRecognizer. Now all of the recognizers

1240
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:40,354
have the same initializer. It has two arguments, the target,

1241
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,856
that's the object that is going to handle this,

1242
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:46,394
it's usually either the controller or the view itself.

1243
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,764
And then it has the action, and that's just the name of

1244
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,667
the method with #selector around it. You see that

1245
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:56,537
#selector in yellow there? That is going to be called

1246
01:07:56,606 --> 01:08:00,341
when this gesture starts to recognize a pan happening.

1247
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:07,949
So then, once we've created a UIPanGestureRecognizer,

1248
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,417
we ask the view,

1249
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,420
please start recognizing this. And we do that by calling

1250
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:15,256
addGestureRecognizer. And a view can have as many gesture

1251
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:16,291
recognizers as you want.

1252
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,826
It could be recognizing 20 different gestures at the same

1253
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,929
time, it's perfectly fine.

1254
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:23,230
All right, so now let's talk about the handler. So

1255
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,567
when a pan starts to happen, a handler's gonna get called.

1256
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:29,537
And the handler's gonna be that pan method that we saw

1257
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:33,541
over there. And inside that method, we're going to have

1258
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,610
to be able to get information about the pan.

1259
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,812
Well, each kind of gesture has it's own information.

1260
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:41,982
Like a pinch gesture has the scale you're pinching to,

1261
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,119
a pan gesture is where is the pan happening. So if you

1262
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,056
look at UIPanGestureRecognizer in the dock,

1263
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,859
you'll see it has methods like translationInView.

1264
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:54,028
That tells you where the pan is in that view.

1265
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:57,565
Or velocity, how fast is the pan happening right now?

1266
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,201
Or even setTranslation, which let's you reset

1267
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,638
that translation in view, so you get incremental panning.

1268
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:07,075
Instead of the continuous length of how far you've

1269
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,476
panned since the start of the pan,

1270
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:11,445
you get how much you got since the last time the pan moved.

1271
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,982
Okay, which can sometimes be useful. Now,

1272
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,584
the abstract superclass UIGestureRecognizer,

1273
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:20,120
it also has a very important var called state. So

1274
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,257
this whole gesture recognizer thing is a state machine, and

1275
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,892
this state var represents that.

1276
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:28,696
So as soon as a gesture becomes possible,

1277
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:31,032
like a pan. Probably a finger touches down,

1278
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:31,999
now it's possible.

1279
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:35,669
And then as soon as it moves, it moves into the began state,

1280
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:39,974
okay, so this pan has begun. And then as the finger moves,

1281
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:43,377
it stays in the changed state. But it really keeps moving

1282
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,513
to the changed state from the changed state over and

1283
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:49,217
over. Now every time one of these state changes happens,

1284
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,587
that handler gets called. Whoever's handling this thing

1285
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:54,755
gets a chance to do it. So for a pan gesture,

1286
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:57,758
you get .changed called every time the thing moves.

1287
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,627
And then eventually the finger goes up,

1288
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,398
and it ended, and you get .ended. So your handler's just

1289
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,533
called every time the state machine changes.

1290
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:09,103
Now, some things, like a swipe, are discrete, either

1291
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:12,139
the swipe happened or it didn't. You don't get .changed

1292
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,710
as your finger's flying across the screen, it's a discreet

1293
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:18,646
gesture. You just get .ended, or for a swipe,

1294
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:23,384
.recognised gets sent to your handler once, and that's it.

1295
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,254
But for continuous gestures, you get the .changed.

1296
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,456
Now, there's also two other interesting states, .failed,

1297
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:33,127
and .cancelled. So .failed can happen when you have multiple

1298
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:36,330
gestures, and one of them wins.

1299
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,900
Like let's say you have, I don't know, a tap gesture and

1300
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,302
a pan gesture. Well, as soon as you go mouse down,

1301
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:42,536
it could be either of them.

1302
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,172
But as soon as it doesn't it come right back up as soon

1303
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,276
as you touch down. Soon as you come back up, it's like,

1304
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:51,078
it can't be a pan anymore, so that one's cancelled,

1305
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:54,415
cuz It failed, basically. So it can go into failed states,

1306
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,952
but that's only if it actually starts up. It wouldn't be

1307
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,922
recognized in the first place if it didn't get that far.

1308
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,758
And then so cancelled is another one that's

1309
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,561
interesting. And this happens a lot with drag and drop.

1310
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,664
Which is, you started something, and it started up,

1311
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:14,635
and it's going good. But then a drag and drop happens, and

1312
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:18,305
now it's canceled. Whatever gesture you were recognizing.

1313
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,041
So you do wanna look for failed and canceled, and

1314
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:24,211
make sure you clean up or whatever. Take away something

1315
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,215
off the screen or whatever, because your gesture has

1316
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:32,286
failed, or has been cancelled by something else. All right,

1317
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:35,356
so given this information, what would our pan handler,

1318
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,525
the handler for the pan look like?

1319
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:40,061
Okay, so it's just pan with the argument being

1320
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,996
the pan gesture recognizer itself handed back to us. And

1321
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:46,533
we switch on the state, we always switch on the state.

1322
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,169
And if it's changed or ended, and

1323
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,671
notice I'm using fallthrough there, but I could have just

1324
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:54,475
said .changed, .ended there. So if it's changed or ended,

1325
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,411
my pan is still moving, or I've just finished it.

1326
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,247
Then I'm gonna find out where the pan was by calling

1327
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,683
translationin: view on the recognizer.

1328
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:07,154
Then I'm gonna do something based on where the pan went.

1329
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:08,288
And maybe if I'm looking for

1330
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:12,159
incremental pans, I'll reset it back to zero. So

1331
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:16,797
that the next one will be from zero and be incremental. So

1332
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:19,733
that's it, simple to do these handlers. Now what are some of

1333
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,902
the concrete handlers besides PanGesture?

1334
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:26,373
Well there's PinchGesture. Its information is the scale. So

1335
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,477
if I start here with a pinch, and I go twice as wide,

1336
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,979
well that's scale 2.0. Or if I start here and

1337
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:35,782
go half as wide, it's 0.5. And there's also velocity for that

1338
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,986
one. There's RotationGesture, which is like turning a knob.

1339
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:41,122
A two-finger gesture turning the knob.

1340
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,124
And in radians, it'll tell you how much the knob has been

1341
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,960
turned in radians. There's a SwipeGesture, and you can,

1342
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,029
now swipe is a little different than these other

1343
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,232
ones in that you configure the swipe. How many fingers?

1344
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,235
What direction, left, right, up, down?

1345
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,772
And then you turn the swipe gesture on by adding it. And

1346
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,075
then when the swipe happens, you'll just get .ended, your

1347
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:04,512
handler will get called with .ended. So it's just, there's

1348
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,747
no, it's different in that you configure it up front and

1349
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,016
then it just tells you whether it recognized it or not.

1350
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:11,052
There's TapGesture,

1351
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:12,887
which feels like it would be like swipe,

1352
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,121
a discrete gesture, but actually,

1353
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,757
since it does double tap and other things, you're always

1354
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:20,027
looking for .ended only with the TapGesture, usually.

1355
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:23,130
But you also configure it like a swipe gesture how many taps,

1356
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,801
how many fingers etc. There's also long press. Long

1357
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,804
press is you hold your finger down on the screen for enough

1358
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,507
time and it starts recognizing it. This is surprisingly

1359
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,209
a continuous gesture, because as you're holding it down your

1360
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:38,045
finger might be moving a little bit and

1361
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,946
that's okay it's not a pan. Okay,

1362
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,882
cuz it can only move a little bit. But

1363
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:45,285
if it does move a little, you'll get .changed.

1364
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,955
And you can configure how much movement you allow and

1365
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:50,992
how long it has to be pressed before it's a LongPress.

1366
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,628
This one gets interrupted a lot by drag and drop.

1367
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:57,031
Because drag and drop uses LongPress. That's how you pick

1368
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,765
something up with drag and drop is LongPress.

1369
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,734
So if you have a LongPress, And there's some drag and

1370
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,270
drop going on, you know the system is very smart about

1371
01:14:03,339 --> 01:14:06,040
figuring which one you actually intend. But

1372
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,109
it could cause your long press to be cancelled.

1373
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:12,413
All right, so let's see all this in action with a demo,

1374
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,015
we only have five minutes left, but I think we can do it

1375
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:18,186
in five or ten minutes. We're gonna add three gestures

1376
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,454
to our playing card. Were gonna add a swipe,

1377
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:23,457
which is gonna flip though our deck of cards. So that's gonna

1378
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,459
affect our model. Our model is that deck of cards, so

1379
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,394
that's something our controller is gonna have to

1380
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:31,131
do. Then we're gonna have tap will turn the card over. We're

1381
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,635
gonna do tap by adding the gesture in the story board,

1382
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:38,338
not even in code. And then we're gonna have pinch which

1383
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,976
I'm gonna use to resize the face card faces. And

1384
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:43,677
that's the view only thing, so the handler for

1385
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:46,847
that will be in the view. And since I won't be back to

1386
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,882
the slides on Friday, no section again,

1387
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,652
Homecoming week. This time we have conflicting schedules, so

1388
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,120
we couldn't do structured section this week,

1389
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:56,357
unfortunately. Next week we'll start doing multiple MVCs,

1390
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,059
View Controller Life Cycle, and hopefully we'll get into

1391
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:03,564
animation as well next week. All right, so here we are,

1392
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,666
let's make our thing look a little better.

1393
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:10,404
Let's go get back and get a nice, nicer thing,

1394
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,406
maybe clubs this time.

1395
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:16,176
And go back here so that x will have our clubs. Okay,

1396
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:20,748
so we have nice looking cards. And, let's do the swipe first.

1397
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:25,319
So the swipe, to do the swipe let me get both our

1398
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,924
controller and our view up on the screen at the same time.

1399
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:33,026
So here's our controller. It just has a deck of cards,

1400
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:37,198
it doesn't really do anything. wanna add a gesture to this

1401
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:41,134
playing card view that is swipe. I need an outlet to it.

1402
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,103
My controller can't talk to that thing with an outlet.

1403
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:46,173
So I'm just gonna control drag like I would drag anything to

1404
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,442
make an outlet. Click it here, it's gonna be an outlet.

1405
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:52,446
It's gonna be my playingCardView is the outlet.

1406
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,881
Here it is. When this gets wired up,

1407
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,318
I'm going to immediately add adjuster recognizer.

1408
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:01,522
So I'm gonna do that in the didSet of this, so that when

1409
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:05,559
iOS sets it I get to execute my code. I'm gonna do a swipe.

1410
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:09,429
So, I'm going to create a swipe gesture,

1411
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,599
UISwipeGestureRecognizer.

1412
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:16,670
And the constructor is this target action thing.

1413
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,473
Since swipe is going to flip through the cards, it's going

1414
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:23,243
to affect the model. So it has to be handled by me,

1415
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:27,848
the controller. Okay, so self is the target. The view can't

1416
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,851
touch the model, so there's no way it could do the swipe. And

1417
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,786
then the selector can just be any function. So,

1418
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:35,856
I'm gonna have a function here called nextCard, which goes to

1419
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,292
the next card. It's not even gonna have any arguments.

1420
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:41,195
That's gonna be the action I want to be called when a swipe

1421
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:45,132
happens. So, I just say #selector and

1422
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:46,600
then I gave the name of it.

1423
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:50,171
Next card, it has no arguments but if it did I would just put

1424
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,606
the args in there. But it doesn't have any arguments so

1425
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,542
we don't need that. Selector(nextCard). So

1426
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,245
that's my swipe gesture. Now we need to configure the swipe

1427
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:00,714
gesture. So for example I can set its direction.

1428
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:04,451
I could say it swipes to the left for example. Swipes to

1429
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,656
the right you could even say, swipes to the left or right.

1430
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,725
Could put a little array notation there, for

1431
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,828
left and right. So now I've got my swipe,

1432
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:18,765
it's gonna be a single, what have we got?

1433
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:22,069
Yeah, so this is an error right here. I'm gonna click

1434
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:25,005
on it. It's gonna cause our screen to get all wonky here,

1435
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:27,608
so let's move it around. Let's look at this error right here.

1436
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:30,243
It says, the argument of #selector refers

1437
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,848
to an instance method nextCard(), which it does.

1438
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:37,384
That is not exposed to Objective-C. My gosh,

1439
01:17:37,453 --> 01:17:41,688
this whole mechanism is built on Objective-C, mechanism of

1440
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,759
target action. So any method that is going to be the action

1441
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,963
of a gesture recognizer has to be marked @objc. That exports

1442
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:53,133
this method out of Swift into the Objective C run-time

1443
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:57,037
which underlies the running of the iOS. Even with Swift code,

1444
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:00,273
still got the Objective-C run-time. Okay, so that's what

1445
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,043
that's all about. This always has to be ,just mark it objc,

1446
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:06,446
It's not a big of a deal, just got to mark it. All right,

1447
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:11,151
let's go back to our split screen here. This and this,

1448
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:15,355
rearrange everything. Back to automatic.

1449
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,759
All right, so now that we have this SwipeGestureRecognizer,

1450
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:20,827
we need to ask this playingCardView,

1451
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:24,131
please start recognizing it. So we say playingCardView,

1452
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:28,134
add this GestureRecognizer(swipe).

1453
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,637
And now it will start recognizing it.

1454
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,440
And that's all we need to do. Now this next card

1455
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:35,742
is the thing that's gonna flip through our cards. So

1456
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,278
how do we implement that? I'm just gonna say if I can get

1457
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:42,349
a card out of my deck. Because my deck might be empty.

1458
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:43,917
That's why I have to do if let there.

1459
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,519
Then I need to set the playing card view's rank

1460
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:49,156
equal to something. And I need to set the playing card view's

1461
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,559
suit equal to something. Now here's where the controller's

1462
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:57,198
doing its job of converting between the two. So

1463
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:59,966
we're going to convert by saying the card's.rank,

1464
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:03,170
luckily we have order which does the card's order, and

1465
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,941
card.suit has its raw value. Okay,

1466
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:11,277
so this is just converting between the model and

1467
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,747
the view there. Everybody got that? So

1468
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:15,482
let's give it a try, see if this works.

1469
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:18,952
So this should swipe through random cards by doing swipes.

1470
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:23,156
So here we go we go, swipe, sure enough, look at that.

1471
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,960
Swiping through. So that was really easy, right? Just have

1472
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,696
that deck. All we had to do is just set the playing card view

1473
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,965
to show a different card each time. All right,

1474
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:35,369
the next thing we're gonna do is tap to flip the card over.

1475
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:39,406
So tap, I'm not even gonna do this code right here.

1476
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,543
Instead I'm gonna go over here, and

1477
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,980
grab a tap gesture from, for this view, from here.

1478
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:49,250
It's down towards the bottom. Look at all these gestures,

1479
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:51,885
pinches, rotations, swipes. Here's tap, and

1480
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,055
I'm gonna drag it to the view I want to recognize a tap.

1481
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,891
Which is my playing card view. I drop it, and it shows up,

1482
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,362
if we zoom in you can see it, right up in this title bar up

1483
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,864
here. You see that right there, Tap Gesture?

1484
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,699
You can click on it and inspect it.

1485
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:07,968
Right, how many taps? How many touches?

1486
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:12,239
You can also control drag from it to set an Action. So

1487
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:15,209
I'm gonna set an Action here. I'm gonna call it flipCard,

1488
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:17,278
cuz that's what I want it to do, flip the card.

1489
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:19,879
I want to fix that anything. Just like any Action,

1490
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:23,050
I want it to fix the argument. So here's my flip card.

1491
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,587
And inside flip card here, I'm just gonna say

1492
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:31,792
playingCardView.isFaceUp = not playingCardView.isFaceUp.

1493
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,094
Okay, I'm just gonna flip the card over, and that's it.

1494
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:37,998
So some gestures are really easy to write. And actually,

1495
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:41,267
I abbreviated that a little bit. And now if I click, you

1496
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:45,873
see how it's flipping it over. Okay, now I know we're rushed,

1497
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,441
but actually I'm going to do the right thing here.

1498
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,277
This really shouldn't be like this. I should switch

1499
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:55,115
on the sender, which is the recognizer's state, and

1500
01:20:55,183 --> 01:21:00,053
make sure that we are in the ended case to do this.

1501
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:02,556
Now, it'll usually work to not do that,

1502
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,225
but I don't wanna show you something that's

1503
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:09,062
really kind of not correct. Okay, and then the last

1504
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:13,033
one we're gonna do is pinching to set the size of the face

1505
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:18,071
card. Well, to do that, I need to go back to my view count,

1506
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:21,075
my view, my custom view over here. And

1507
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:23,910
I need to make it possible to change that, So right now,

1508
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:28,181
actually, let's go here. Okay, view.

1509
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,252
Okay, so right now the size of my face card, remember that's

1510
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:35,355
a constant. This SizeRatio.faceCardImageSizeTo-

1511
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:38,124
BoundsSize, so I'm gonna change that to be a var.

1512
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:41,761
I'm gonna call it faceCardScale. Okay,

1513
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,797
so I need to create a new var to do that. So let's go up,

1514
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:47,167
do it all at the top. So we can easily see it here,

1515
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:51,037
var faceCardScale. It's going to be a CGFloat.

1516
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:56,610
I'll set it equal to that constant. Don't forget to do

1517
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:01,114
this. Okay, although we don't really need

1518
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,917
setNeedsLayout because changing the card size,

1519
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:06,887
the faceCard does not affect the corners, okay. So

1520
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:11,057
I don't need to relayout. So I've got that faceCardScale,

1521
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:14,160
so now I'm gonna create a little func that is going to

1522
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,162
be a handler for a pinch gesture.

1523
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:19,366
Okay, I'm gonna call it, adjust, I had a good name for

1524
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,902
here so it's easy to understand what it is.

1525
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:28,108
What did I call this thing? adjustFaceCardScale(byHandlin-

1526
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:33,647
gGestureRecodnizedBy recognizer: UIPinch),

1527
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:38,852
now, this is an intentionally long name there.

1528
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:41,254
So that you'd understand that this is the handler for

1529
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,858
the gesture. And since it's a handler, it needs to be @objc,

1530
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:48,161
of course. And, inside here, I'm just gonna switch on

1531
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,630
the recognizer's state, as I always do.

1532
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:54,168
That's what we do in standard in these handlers. And

1533
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:57,604
if it's changed, so the pinch has changed or

1534
01:22:57,673 --> 01:23:01,575
if it's ended, then I'm going to set my faceCardScale,

1535
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:04,645
this thing I just created up here, okay,

1536
01:23:04,714 --> 01:23:09,349
to be*= recognizer.scale.

1537
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,319
Now, I only want incremental changes because I'm changing

1538
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,988
the scale each time. So, otherwise, it would

1539
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:17,958
just start to be exponential. So I'm gonna reset

1540
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:21,928
the recognizer's scale to 1.0 each time that this happens.

1541
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,198
And then we're gonna ignore all other states of the state

1542
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:30,304
machine. We don't care when it began and all that, stuff. So

1543
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:33,307
now we're gonna have this adjustFaceCardScale(byHandlin-

1544
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:38,011
gGesture recognizer) be added back in our controller as

1545
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,747
a pinch gesture. So here I'm gonna create a pinch gesture.

1546
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,950
Let pinch = UIPinchGestureRecognizer,

1547
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,554
same target inaction thing as the other one, but

1548
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:51,825
this time the target is going to be the playingCardView.

1549
01:23:51,894 --> 01:23:53,260
It's gonna handle this directly.

1550
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:55,062
It's not gonna go to the controller, and

1551
01:23:55,131 --> 01:24:02,469
the selector is that method we had over there.

1552
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:07,040
Okay, it's in our view, and I'm gonna call it pinch. Okay,

1553
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:10,243
and now I just need to tell the playingCardView to add

1554
01:24:10,312 --> 01:24:14,247
this gesture recognizer pinch, and it will start recognizing.

1555
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:18,886
Okay, so let's take a look. Oops,

1556
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:23,357
what did I do wrong here? What does it say?

1557
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,830
Unresolved, okay, let's use scape completion here, adjust,

1558
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,866
sorry, PlayingCardView. I need to say that it's in

1559
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:36,937
PlayingCardView. That's the problem there, handler.

1560
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:45,412
Sorry about that. Okay, so let's find a face card.

1561
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:47,948
Here it is. How do you pinch in the simulator?

1562
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:50,484
You hold down Option, you get these grey things, and

1563
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:55,555
when you mouse down, you get to pinch. So

1564
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,357
see how that's only effecting the view?

1565
01:24:57,425 --> 01:25:00,627
It's not effecting anything else, effects all the cards

1566
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:06,967
And that's it. Okay, sorry to rush that at the end. You'll

1567
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:08,802
be doing all this stuff in your assignment number three,

1568
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:10,470
which just went out. It's due in a week,

1569
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,139
in other words before lecture next Wednesday. And

1570
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:14,374
I will see you all then,

1571
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,508
actually, I'll see you on Monday.

1572
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:16,543
And if you have questions,

1573
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,012
I'm here, as always. >> For
