Stanford University. >> All right,

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:14,046
well, welcome to lecture number 14 of Stanford CS193P,
欢迎来到斯坦福 CS193P 的第十四节课

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,884
fall of 2017, 18. So, I'm going to finish off the thing
现在是 2017-18 年秋季学期

5
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,254
we had about the documents last time, I was hoping to

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,489
have finished that last time. So we're kind of rushed for

7
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,025
time this time, especially since we're gonna get kicked

8
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,794
out again for a midterm right after. And then I'm gonna

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,364
launch into a long demo that's gonna basically demonstrate

10
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,300
all of the stuff we talked about on Monday.

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,504
All right, so we did all that stuff on Monday so that we

12
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,075
could easily take whatever our document-based app is,

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,743
and store it in a document. We went all the way through

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,314
having UIDocument write things out to the file system.

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,751
Now we're gonna add a really cool layer of UI in the front

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,754
of that, so that users can pick the documents they want.

17
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,024
Rename them, move them around, all that right inside your

18
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,327
app. And the UI for this, as you can see the screenshot of,

19
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,597
looks a lot like the files app in iOS 11. In fact,

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,034
the files app in iOS 11 is probably just a very thin

21
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,104
layer on top of this UI, or this API,

22
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,340
the UIDocumentBrowserViewControl-

23
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,709
ler. So how does this thing work,

24
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,378
this view controller? Well, the most important thing to

25
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,447
understand is that it's just a view controller, but

26
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,183
it's always the root view controller of

27
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,452
your application. So in other words, in your storyboard,

28
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,122
it's always got the little arrow that points to it. And

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,323
when you run your app,

30
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,926
it's gonna be the view controller users see first.

31
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,062
Then they'll pick whatever document they want, and

32
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,797
then your UI will take over.

33
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,166
Your view controller will come up in front of this one,

34
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,769
do whatever it does to show your document. All right, so

35
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,305
that's the fundamental architecture of this thing.

36
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,676
And one thing that's important to tell this little document

37
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:54,446
browser view controller is what types of files you open,

38
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,080
and you do that on your project settings. So

39
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,451
if you go to project settings underneath the info tab,

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,686
you gotta select your target, not the project, but

41
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,155
the target. Go to the info tab, and then inside there,

42
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,225
there's a little section there called document types.

43
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,793
Well, that's the types of documents you open, and

44
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,961
you just fill out this.

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,564
You can have multiple types when you fill out this little

46
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,800
form, like that one. In here, for example,

47
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,468
I've shown how to have JSON files be a kind of file that

48
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,505
you open, and it's pretty straightforward there.

49
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,108
The little things at the bottom there, the BundleType

50
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,644
and the HandleRank, are basically just saying, well,

51
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,613
is this like a primary type of file that you open?

52
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:32,217
Are you the owner of this type of file, or is it just some

53
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,587
other type that you can, that you know how to open,

54
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,456
etc. Now, you can have your own document type,

55
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,824
for example, for emojiart,

56
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,594
I'm not gonna get to it today because of time constraints.

57
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,531
But emojiart really wants to have its own document type,

58
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,002
.emojiart or something like that. And you set that up in

59
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,704
the section right below the document types,

60
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,108
called exported UTIs, UTI stands for Universal Type and

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,610
Identifier. And you can invent your own UTI,

62
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,578
as long as it's a nice, unique name.

63
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,549
Like here, I've used the name edu.stanford.cs193p.emojiart,

64
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,153
that's very likely to be a unique type identifier.

65
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,955
I just have to specify a couple of things,

66
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,723
most notably at the bottom there,

67
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,592
the file name extension that goes with an emoji art,

68
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:19,631
I picked emojiart, .emojiart. And then once you set this up,

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,400
you can go back up to the document types one at the top,

70
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,137
and add this as a document type that you open.

71
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,706
Just like that, and yeah, and I explained the UTI there.

72
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:33,845
Now we, you know, from the start of this class,

73
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,082
we always picked single view app as the type of app that we

74
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,617
opened. But we're actually, for document based apps,

75
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,452
we're going to use an Xcode template.

76
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,888
It doesn't really give us much in that template,

77
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,024
but it gives enough that it's worth doing.

78
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,959
So if you're gonna do a document based app,

79
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:52,430
I recommend going back and creating a new app,

80
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,200
a new project, using this as the template. And in fact,

81
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,635
I'm gonna do that in the demo, even though we're, you know,

82
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,037
80% of the way through emojiart,

83
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,105
I'm still gonna go back and

84
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,539
create a new emojiart with this, and

85
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,707
then just move my files over.

86
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,809
Because I want the things that come with the template, and

87
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,444
let's talk about what's in that template.

88
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,647
One thing is that it stubs out that

89
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,883
document types, and it doesn't do JSON files.

90
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,819
It does image files, but you can change it to JSON files or

91
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,622
add more types. It also puts an entry in your

92
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,624
Info.plist which is very important,

93
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,594
called Supports Document Browser. And that's basically

94
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,263
just saying that the documents that are stored inside

95
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,132
your app sandbox are like real documents that people would

96
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,403
wanna open with like the files app or something like that. So

97
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,605
that's an important entry to put in your Info.plist,

98
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,574
we're actually going to put that into the demo manually,

99
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,308
just to emphasize it.

100
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,777
It has one method in AppDelegate, you know,

101
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,979
AppDelegate's that file that we're always moving out of

102
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,417
the way, into supporting files. So it has one method in

103
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,619
there that allows other apps, like the files app,

104
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,990
to ask your app to open your documents. And it's a very

105
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,292
simple little method, we're not really gonna look at it

106
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,195
today, but this template does throw that in there for you.

107
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,664
It also stubs out a subclass of UIDocument, which you

108
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,868
usually don't need, cuz you've already created that yourself.

109
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,970
And it also stubs out an MVC to show the document,

110
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,740
just this really dumb MVC. And you don't need that, usually,

111
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,609
either, because you obviously have an MVC that shows your

112
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,046
document, or you wouldn't be writing this app. And finally,

113
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,882
it gives a subclass of UIDocumentBrowserViewControl-

114
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,650
ler, which serves as its own delegate.

115
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,054
It just has like five methods in it that are really simple,

116
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,456
and we're gonna go over those in detail. So

117
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,891
after you create a project with this template,

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,094
what do you need to do to get your app working? Well, one,

119
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,929
you've gotta have your own UIDocument subclass, of

120
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,701
course. Two, you've gotta have your own document-viewing MVC,

121
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,703
right? Like EmojiArtViewController,

122
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,872
or your ImageGalleryViewController,

123
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,509
whatever from your homework. Then you have to add

124
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,046
a little bit of code to this UIDocumentBrowserViewContro-

125
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,282
ller subclass that comes with the template. In its

126
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,551
viewDidLoad, you're gonna configure it a little bit,

127
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,052
it has a couple of bars you can set,

128
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,289
we'll talk about that. You're also going to have to provide

129
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,493
the URL of a blank document. And

130
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,962
this is so that when the user goes into the UI and

131
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,332
says, create a new document, you've got, it's gotta

132
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,902
copy some template, some blank version of your document,

133
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,705
to be that new document. So you just have to give the URL

134
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:17,141
of a blank document, so that you support document creation.

135
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,544
And then finally, the code you have to put in there is,

136
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,182
when someone wants to open one of your documents, you have to

137
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:28,019
write the code to put in MVC onscreen. And you don't do it

138
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,122
with segueing, so we're gonna learn a little bit new way to

139
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,694
put an MVC on screen that does not involve segues. And

140
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,528
the last thing you wanna do to the template, of course,

141
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,498
is update those types, the document types to be,

142
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,235
not be imaged, but to be JSON or emojiart type or

143
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,437
image gallery type for your homework, or whatever. So

144
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,240
those are the only four things you do, once you do those four

145
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,076
simple things, you'll get this full UI. So steps one and

146
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,313
two, you've probably already done in your app.

147
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,082
Step three looks like this, this is viewDidLoad of

148
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,519
the UIDocumentBrowser ViewController's subclass.

149
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,022
And you really have to the first thing,

150
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,291
which is set it as its own delegate.

151
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,293
Because it actually implements a lot of these opening

152
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,463
file methods and stuff using its own delegate methods.

153
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,566
Then you can have some things like, allowsDocumentCreation =

154
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,403
true. Do you allow people to create documents in your app,

155
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,639
or are you just a document viewer? Do you allow multiple

156
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,942
items to be picked, in other words, can the user go in and

157
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,612
like Shift + click, or whatever the equivalent is,

158
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,281
with the touch interface, to choose multiple items and

159
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,450
open them at once? Like Emoji Art can't do that,

160
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,519
it can only show one document at a time.

161
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,589
Then you can also tweak the look of the UI a little bit.

162
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,624
Change the colors, tint colors,

163
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,360
things like that, to try and match your document controller

164
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,195
when it comes up to have the same kinda look.

165
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,932
So that's it, that's how you configure it in viewDidLoad,

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,933
that's mostly the settings that you can set.

167
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,337
And then you have to provide this template URL, you do it

168
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,807
kind in a weird way. There's this method, DocumentBrowser

169
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:59,077
didRequestDocumentCreationWit- hHandler. That's the method

170
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,779
that's saying, somebody wants to create a document of your

171
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,684
type in your app. What do you got to give me is a URL

172
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,386
to a template, to a blank. And the way it makes you

173
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,055
do that is it hands you a little function called

174
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,691
the importHandler. There it's called,

175
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,928
I guess I called it Handler to make it shorter.

176
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,164
But it's actually called importHandler and

177
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,100
it just takes a URL which is the URL of a blank document.

178
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,969
And then the import mode which is either copy this or

179
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,905
move it to create a new document. So, it would be move

180
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,441
if you created this thing every time this got called.

181
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,144
It's copy if you create it once and then you hand it

182
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,480
out every time someone says new document.

183
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,515
And that's it, all you have to do is call that handler,

184
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,585
super simple, you'll see that in the demo. Next, you have to

185
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,489
present your document MVC, so we have to take a little time

186
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,024
out and go to an aside and learn something different

187
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,596
which is how to put MVC on screen without segueing. So

188
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,633
how do we do that? It's quite easy. There's a method

189
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,936
in UIViewController called present animated.

190
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,472
You send it to yourself, if you're a ViewController, and

191
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,242
you give it an argument of another MVC, and it

192
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,545
presents it animated. And it presents it on screen modally,

193
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,082
which means it takes over the entire screen. Okay and

194
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,418
just owns the entire screen until it dismisses itself,

195
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,855
then it's back to you. Which is exactly what we want here.

196
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:23,695
So, the trick here though is how do I get a new MVC

197
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,413
I told you actually earlier that iOS has a few MVCs like

198
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,064
to present? And

199
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,867
the camera take, picture taking MVC and somethings.

200
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,537
So it has some, but what if you have one of your own?

201
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,039
Okay well, it's really easy actually. You just put it in

202
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,242
your storyboard, it won't have any segues drawn to it,

203
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,412
but what you're going to do is name it. You're just going to

204
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,215
select it, go to your identity inspector, there's a little

205
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,250
storyboard ID in there, you give it a name and

206
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,754
then you use that name in your code like this. You get

207
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,323
an instance of your storyboard which you get by saying

208
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,926
UIStoryboard name. You that our storyboard has always been

209
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,496
called Main.storyboard. But we haven't talked about the fact

210
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,365
that you can actually have multiple storyboards,

211
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,101
probably legal. We always just have that main. And

212
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,571
bundle is almost nil there, cuz you got your main bundle,

213
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,306
and nil means your main bundle. So

214
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,807
you get the storyboard, and then you ask

215
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,011
the storyboard to make you an MVC with that name by saying

216
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,013
instantiateViewControllerWith- Identifer.

217
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,782
And that foo that you have there is the thing

218
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,684
that's in my identity inspector for that MVC for

219
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,389
the controller, top level controller of that MVC. And

220
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,691
that's it, now you just prepared that thing.

221
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,561
In this case, you know by setting its document and

222
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,396
then you just present it. So it's really, really easy and

223
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,832
instantiateViewControllerWith- Identifier is the key method

224
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,235
that you need without a storyboard.

225
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,904
All right, so back to our present. So we need to be able

226
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,540
to write a function that presents it. And it's really

227
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,076
simple, we're just gonna get our storyboard, we're gonna

228
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,411
instantiate our ViewController from the storyboard.

229
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,749
Now, really importantly we're gonna set the document

230
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,317
of the document showing MVC that we just got

231
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,488
out of the storyboard, we're gonna set it to be a new

232
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,757
document with URL that's passed to us, because it's

233
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,260
presentDocument at url. Now this might be a new document,

234
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,596
it just created by copying that template or

235
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,798
it might be some document we're opening

236
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,801
that was created in the past. You don't know and

237
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,337
you don't care here. And then you just called present

238
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,340
of that document MVC. That's it,

239
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,177
if you do all that, then it just will all work. Of course,

240
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:22,313
you wanna set the types that you do, JSON, Emoji Art,

241
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,383
whatever. And we're gonna see all of this happening

242
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:28,619
in Emoji Art. So let's jump right into the demo and

243
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,991
do this in Emoji Art. Now, Emoji Art is an obvious app

244
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,494
to want to turn into a document based app. Because

245
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,897
building these beautiful works of art with emoji, right?

246
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,533
And we certainly might want to do multiple of them, not just

247
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,404
have to constantly be working on the same one. So there's

248
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:50,407
something about our MVC, our EmojiArtViewController.

249
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,944
The view controller that shows our Emoji Art document.

250
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,415
It has no model, right? We have no model in this thing.

251
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,552
It's just all view. All the EmojiArtView especially. So

252
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,555
I'm going to add another section here at the top

253
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,925
to put my model. I'm going to put this in my Model section

254
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,528
right here. Everyone remember that these marks that you put,

255
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,396
that causes it so

256
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,398
that when you go up here to the top, you can,

257
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,867
these are like in sections. You see the sections there?

258
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,202
So I've added a new one up here, Model. And

259
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,839
you can click on them to jump to the different sections. So

260
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,676
my Model, it wants to be some sort of var, I'll call it

261
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:29,647
emojiArt. And it's gonna be of some type, like EmojiArt.

262
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,650
This type doesn't exist, but that's kind of what my model

263
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:37,822
wants to be. So, let's invent a struct here, or class or

264
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,924
struct, that represents an Emoji Art document.

265
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,194
Well, what's in an Emoji Art document?

266
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,462
There's the URL in the background and

267
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,032
then there's all those emojis, what they are, and

268
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,034
where they are, and how big they are, right?

269
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,771
That's what an Emoji Art document looks like. So,

270
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,273
let's go create a model to do exactly that.

271
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,675
So I'm going to create a new file, just a model file.

272
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,144
So we're over here in Swift, not over here at Cocoa Touch,

273
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,481
we're over here with Swift File. I'm going to call it

274
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,185
Emoji Art. Makes perfect sense to call it that. Here it is,

275
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,055
I'm going to type it in really fast. There it is.

276
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,491
And so here it is. Makes perfect sense what it is,

277
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,828
right? URL, that's for the background, then an array

278
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,532
of these EmojiInfos which is this thing. And each EmojiInfo

279
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,235
is its position, x and y, the text that's like a bike or

280
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,373
the bee, or whatever the string is, and then the size,

281
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,142
which I'm gonna have be the font size. Notice I've made

282
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,911
these Ints instead of CG floats or whatever because

283
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,081
this is a model okay this is not a UI thing, it's our

284
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,984
model. So these could be Ints or they could be doubles but

285
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,754
I decided I want Ints because I want my JSON to look nice

286
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,456
and not have a lot of fractional numbers and

287
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,959
all that stuff, so I decided to make them into Ints.

288
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,528
And that's it, this fully represents an Emoji Art

289
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,131
document this is just initializer that initializes

290
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,534
those two things. Nothing else to it but this, all right.

291
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,872
Now let's think about our EmojiArtViewController back

292
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,408
here. What does it need to be able to interact with

293
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,612
the model? Well, it needs all those little UI labels that

294
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,049
are in its EmojiArtView. No problem. We can get those.

295
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,916
We're the controller. We can talk to our view and

296
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,054
get anything we want from it. But it also needs the URL and

297
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:19,257
currently we actually don't keep the URL for

298
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,524
the background image.

299
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,593
Let's go scroll down to where we get that image,

300
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,897
it's right at the bottom here. When we drop an image, and

301
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,766
you can see our image fetcher goes off and fetches

302
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,003
that url and image. But then we only use the image.

303
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,940
We don't use the URL. So, we're gonna start doing that.

304
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,875
And I'm gonna do it in a way just to show you

305
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,878
a little bit more kind of Swift program, which is

306
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,515
I'm gonna make this var, which is currently a UIImage,

307
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,185
be a tuple. And why would I make this a tuple? Well,

308
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,421
I'm gonna make it a tuple because I want the URL and

309
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,857
the image to always be set together. I would never want

310
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,494
to accidentally set the image and have the URL be different.

311
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,763
So I'm gonna always set them together. So I'm gonna change

312
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,032
this from being a UIImage to being a tuple.

313
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,699
So let's go find out where it's declared,

314
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,669
here it is. It's currently a UIImage,

315
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,841
I'm gonna change it to be a tuple that has a URL and

316
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,743
an image as part of the tuple. And of course,

317
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,579
changing this thing's type is gonna require me to change its

318
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,949
implementation a little bit. Like all these new values down

319
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,786
here aren't UIImages anymore, they're this tuple, so

320
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:27,224
we gotta say newValue.image when I want the image. And of

321
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,428
course when I'm returning it I can't just return the image

322
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,466
here I after return the tuple with some URL of some sort and

323
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,802
that UIImage and what URL am I gonna return. Well,

324
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,371
I'm gonna actually have to store that,

325
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,872
so I'm gonna make a little private var.

326
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:46,076
I'm gonna call emojiArtBackgroundImageURL,

327
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,080
which is gonna be URL. And I'm gonna store it in there. Now,

328
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,982
I'm not gonna wanna set it from here,

329
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,351
I'm gonna always want to set it from here,

330
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,052
but I'm just gonna be using this as storage.

331
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,955
Some people might put an under bar in front of this here to

332
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,692
kind of emphasize, that this is background storage.

333
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,227
We're not gonna ever set this directly.

334
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,530
We set the URL here, so it's always set The same so

335
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,066
I'm gonna leave it under bar there too.

336
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,368
So this URL here then is this one.

337
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,839
So I'm just gonna return this URL. And of course when I set,

338
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,343
I need to set the URL to be this new values URL. Okay so

339
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,511
now I'm capturing the URL all the time,

340
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,048
I always have the URL anytime I have an image. That's good,

341
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,920
I need it for my model. Now let's talk about the model

342
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,424
here, we could have this model just stored like this and

343
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,827
then have some other functions that like go and

344
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,763
look at all of our UI labels and grab the URL and

345
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,666
build an emojiArt, but you know,

346
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:46,770
I'm gonna do something fun. Watch this,

347
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,910
I'm gonna make this

348
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:59,083
a computed property

349
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:04,488
be a perfect match

350
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:09,460
with my UI. And that is a really

351
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,963
good thing to have in a controller is the model and

352
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,633
the UI always in sync. So, that's why I'm gonna do this.

353
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,369
And I think it'll work out nicely here. All right, so

354
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,772
what do I need to do get my model? I gotta return the URL,

355
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,008
and I gotta return all those little emoji infos, right?

356
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,679
I'm eventually gonna have to return some emoji art by

357
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:33,784
calling its initializer, url with some url, and the emojis

358
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:38,455
with some emojis. So we need these two vars to be created.

359
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,024
Well, the URL is really easy,

360
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,394
I'm just gonna say if I get let url = my

361
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:51,802
emojiArtBackgroundImage. URL that's it's URL.

362
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,472
If I can do that then I'm ready to return something

363
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,476
here. By the way if I can't do that then I'm going to return

364
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:03,581
Nil because for me my emoji art is not really

365
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,084
well defined if it doesn't have a background. It doesn't

366
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,652
really make sense to have emoji art where there's like

367
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,688
a bee and a bike on a plain background,

368
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,357
we don't really support that. So I'm just going to say,

369
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,993
if you ask for my model and I don't have a URL yet,

370
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,328
then I'm just going to say I don't have a model yet.

371
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,299
I'm not been created enough to say that I have one. So

372
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,535
that fixes the URL. How about this emojis thing right here?

373
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,907
We have to set this emojis var right here, so I'm just gonna

374
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:35,412
say, let emojis =. And essentially what I wanna do

375
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:40,584
here is go ask my emojiArtView for all its subviews.

376
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,420
But I really don't want all of them, I just want the ones

377
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:48,425
that I can get as a UILabel. I'm using map here, you

378
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:52,730
all know map. So this returned in array fo UI labels.

379
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,066
The only thing about this is, this might return nil. So

380
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,202
I actually want to use a different map called flat Map.

381
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,473
So flat Map is just like map, is just if the little function

382
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,410
returns nil it ignores it. So it flats it down not to have

383
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,447
the nil ones, all right. So now I have all my UI labels.

384
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,318
Now I need to turn this into an array of these

385
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,154
emojiinfos. All right because that's what I'm doing, I'm

386
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,823
returning my model. So how the heck am I going to do that?

387
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,993
I'm definitely going to need a function that takes a UI label

388
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,429
and returns one of these emojiinfos.

389
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,497
You know what I'm gonna do,

390
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,700
I'm actually gonna do that by writing an extension

391
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,803
to this struck. And I'm gonna put that extension

392
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,340
over here in my controller because that extension

393
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,377
is gonna take a UI label as an argument and

394
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,279
return an emoji info as the value.

395
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,249
And that UI label is a UI thing so that can not be in my

396
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:49,686
model. But it can be in my controller, and

397
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,056
this is my controller. And some people say, well,

398
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,593
wait a second. If you put an extension here to EmojiInfo,

399
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,296
you've just added UI to your model.

400
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,666
No, this is my controller. Not my model,

401
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,769
the fact that my controller is implementing this with makes

402
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,572
extension, this extension lives in my controller so

403
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,409
that is perfectly legal to do and you'll see IOS do that

404
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,211
where you have something like NS attributed string,

405
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,513
which is actually in foundation, I think.

406
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,183
But, when you start adding attributes like fonts and so

407
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,286
like that now becomes UI thing,

408
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,689
all that stuff is implemented the UI kit. By extension,

409
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,026
in NSAttributeString. We're doing the same thing here. So

410
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,795
I decided to do this, instead of with a function,

411
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,164
I actually add an extension that adds a new initializer

412
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,035
to EmojiInfo. Initializes it with a label, and if I can

413
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,071
get the attributedText out of there and get its font,

414
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,274
then I can make myself an EmojiInfo. If I can't,

415
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,112
I'm gonna return nil, so this is failable initializer,

416
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,551
this is how you fail out of a failable initializer. So,

417
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,152
now that I can do that so easily,

418
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,289
I'm just gonna take this array of UI labels right here, and

419
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:02,059
I'm going to flat map that. And the thing here I'm gonna

420
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:06,664
say is return an EmojiArt.EmoliInfo

421
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:11,234
using my nice new label initializer. And

422
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:17,474
remember that $0 right here is these UI labels. You got that?

423
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:21,044
It's kinda cool. All right, so that's our emoji has.

424
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,382
That is creating out EmojiArt, that's it. That's all we need

425
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,153
to do to get our model. How about the set side of it?

426
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,522
Well ,the first thing I wanna do when someone sets a new

427
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,658
EmojiArt is clear out what I've already got in there.

428
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:39,330
So I'm gonna set my EmojiArt Background image to nil,

429
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,031
it's a tuple, remember? And

430
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,568
I'm gonna set all of my emojiArtview.subviews, but

431
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,038
actually only the ones that are labels.

432
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,810
I'm gonna send a message to all of them for

433
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,882
each to remove themselves from their Superview.

434
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,122
Okay so I'm just taking all the labels in there and

435
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,458
removing them because somebody set a new model so I'm

436
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,663
clearing everything out here. As question mark, there we go.

437
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,034
So now I cleared everything out, now I need to put

438
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,770
this new thing in. Well, to put the URL in,

439
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,207
I'm gonna need to fetch it. So let's fetch it,

440
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,444
here is how I fetch right, here is my image fetcher,

441
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,548
doing the same thing, I did when some thing was dropped.

442
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,450
I'm gonna do this back on the main cube because now I'm

443
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,756
gonna update my UI with this URL when it came back. So

444
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,392
what am I gonna do when this thing comes back?

445
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,693
First of all, I got to set my background image. So

446
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:48,898
I'm gonna set my image, oops, my emoji Emoji art

447
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:53,537
image background equal to the URL and image that came back,

448
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,206
again this is a tuple. I'm setting it from here, coming

449
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,309
back from the ImageFetcher. And now I need to

450
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,280
add all those labels for all the emoji, right. The bees and

451
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,182
the bikes and everything that I've dragged down,

452
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,519
I've got to put all of those in there, so let's do that.

453
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,688
Probably the easiest way to do that, kinda conceptually,

454
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,191
I'm gonna take this new value of the emoji art,

455
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,226
and look through all of its emojis.

456
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,630
And for each of them, I kinda wanna just ask my

457
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:25,669
emojiArtView, to add a label

458
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,406
with the right arguments, whatever for each one, right?

459
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,842
This is conceptually what I wanna do. Well, actually,

460
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,544
I have add label in my emoji art view, but I made it

461
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,280
private. So I'm gonna go over to my emoji art view and make

462
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:42,452
that public. And remember that I'm the controller over there.

463
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,988
I can call anything I want in my view. My view can't call

464
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,624
anything at me without that blind structure communication,

465
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,126
but I can call anything I want in it.

466
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:50,360
So in here, we have label and

467
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,195
it looks like it wants an attributed string and

468
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,132
the point. That makes sense, so let's go back over here and

469
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:02,239
do that. So, the attributed Text,

470
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:07,077
is that what they called it? We want some attributed, no,

471
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:12,916
it's just with, I think, with attributed,

472
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:17,454
yeah. Attributed text, and centeredAt, actually,

473
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:22,425
I already know centeredAt. centeredAt is just a CG

474
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:27,831
point with the X being this $0.x.

475
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,035
And the y is this $0.y.

476
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:36,473
Because $0 is each of these emojis, so it's in EmojiInfo.

477
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,609
EmojiInfo, just to remind you, is this thing, so

478
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,146
the x and y, this is the x and y position. Now I need to deal

479
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,149
with the text and the size, so let's do that.

480
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,186
And we do that by letting that attributedText argument equals

481
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,590
the text converted to an attributed string. I actually

482
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,092
have this nice little function I wrote in utilities called

483
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,461
attributedString(withTextSty- le). And so

484
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,133
I'm gonna make it .body font, of a certain size,

485
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:08,004
which is a CGFloat of the $0's size. So there we've set and

486
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,608
if now someone sets our model, boom! We've set everything.

487
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,811
Our UIs should match. Now we're in great shape,

488
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,947
because we've got an MVC here. Which has a model that we can

489
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,151
set and get that makes our UI work and all we need to do is

490
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,322
make it persistent. Make it store on disk. And we're gonna

491
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,559
make it persistent by having this EmojiArt thing here

492
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,928
become codable, and be able to turn itself into a JSON.

493
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,799
And then we're gonna use JSON as our file format. So

494
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,002
let's go back to EmojiArt over here, and

495
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,671
make this thing generate JSON. And

496
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,475
we're gonna do that by just saying that it is Codable. And

497
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,878
when we put Codable on there, and we recompile.

498
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,981
We're gonna see if there's any problems with this and

499
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,151
see whether it is codable or not. So let's find out, and

500
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,554
it says it's not. It says it doesn't implement decodable

501
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,491
and encodable, which are the two protocols in this Codable

502
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,395
protocol, why not? This is codable, an array is codable,

503
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:09,332
no, this type is not codable, well,

504
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:14,204
no problem, colon, Codable. We made that Codable, and now,

505
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,341
we'll let this thing recompile, and the error went

506
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,543
away, look at that, we just made EmojiArt codable.

507
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,346
And this is what I was telling you about, this codable stuff,

508
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,015
the new kind of archiving is so easy.

509
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,384
Because you don't need to do all of that inits, and decode,

510
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:31,021
and encode, and all of that stuff. For 90% of all structs,

511
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,924
it'll just do it for you. Now, again,

512
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:37,527
our JSON keys are gonna be the same as our variable names.

513
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,295
When we do the JSON, which is good, in this case,

514
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,564
cuz they're all nice enough. But

515
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,367
we could change it by adding that private enum coding keys,

516
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,868
colon string, remember that?

517
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,071
So I, we're not going to, but, but we could do that.

518
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,307
All right, now, how about the JSON?

519
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,844
How do we get the JSON version of this? Well,

520
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:58,181
I'm actually gonna add a var to this EmojiArt called json.

521
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,351
And it returns a Data, optional, it's possible,

522
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,888
I guess, we might not be able to turn ourselves into JSON.

523
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,124
But I think 100% we would, but

524
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,628
I'll make it a Data just be clear. And I'm just going to

525
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:16,800
create a JSON out of myself by returning, trying

526
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:23,373
to use a JSONEncoder to encode my, self, and that's it.

527
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,343
That's either gonna return a data of myself, a JSON, or

528
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,845
nil if it couldn't do it, now this is never gonna

529
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,615
fail. I'm so confident this is never gonna fail, I could even

530
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,316
do try exclamation point right there and

531
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,485
not make that an optional.

532
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:39,256
Cuz these types are all 100% encodable. But

533
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,392
I'll do this just to kind of be correct programming.

534
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,295
So now we have a way to turn this thing into EmojiArt.

535
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,765
So let's add a little bit of UI to our EmojiArt to have

536
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,603
a button I'm gonna call save. Which you press save, and

537
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:55,471
it's going to eventually save this JSON,

538
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,175
this EmojiArt document to disk as JSON.

539
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,276
But first, we'll just have it print the JSON out on

540
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,512
the console, so we can just see what's going on here.

541
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,749
So let's do that, let's go to our storyboard and add a save

542
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,151
button here. Now if we look in our storyboard, look,

543
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,921
we've got a lot of junk in here. This is that table view

544
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,923
that we put to try and have our documents in a table view.

545
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,994
Hm, well, we're gonna have a significant upgrade here,

546
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,729
because we're gonna use that nice files app thing.

547
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,865
So I'm just going to delete this junk.

548
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:26,603
Get rid of all that, and I want to now put a save button

549
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:29,840
somewhere here in this UI. You know what I'm gonna do?

550
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,743
I'm gonna Embed this into Navigation Controller, so

551
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,945
that I get the little title bar at the top,

552
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:37,681
you see this little title bar that comes at the top?

553
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,284
Cuz that's a good place I could put a little save button

554
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,052
too. So throwing things in Navigation Controller,

555
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,588
you get that title bar, it's actually quite common and

556
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,492
a quite nice feature. So let's go down here and search for

557
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,162
Bar Button, Bar Button, here it is.

558
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,764
We always use bar buttons in these bars, not regular

559
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,700
buttons. And I'm going to inspect that bar button and

560
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,804
make it be a Save, a standard button called Save,

561
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:04,140
there it is. Let's wire it up, target action,

562
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:09,012
into our controller here. So, control drag, down here, it's

563
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,249
going to be an action, I'm going to call it save. That's

564
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,252
going to be a bar button item as its argument, there we go,

565
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:20,524
here it is. Let's go back to full screen so we can get the,

566
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,060
oops, get the full width here to do our save.

567
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,832
So this save, I just wanted to print my model out as JSON on

568
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:33,704
the console. So, to do that, I'm just gonna say,

569
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,807
if I can let json = my model, if I have one,

570
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:44,081
it's json. Now I have the json, it's a data, though.

571
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,217
And I want to print it out, obviously, as a string. And

572
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,787
when you have a data and you want to print it as a string,

573
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:54,257
you have to tell the system what the encoding is like,

574
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:58,461
is it ASCII? Or Unicode, some sort of Unicode thing?

575
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,965
Well, JSON is always UTF8, which is Unicode encoding,

576
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,634
eight bit encoding.

577
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:11,141
So, we're just going to let, if let jsonString = String,

578
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,078
constructor, with taking that json that I have.

579
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,481
And telling it what the encoding is, which is dot,

580
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,252
you can see there is a lot of different kinds of isoLatin1

581
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,923
and shiftJIS. And all these things, ascii right there, but

582
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,393
we're gonna do utf8. So if we're able to do that,

583
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:34,130
then I'm just gonna print it, print(jsonString). So,

584
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,332
now we're our save button is gonna print it out,

585
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,202
so let's go ahead and give this a try.

586
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,537
You see a little bit of warnings over there.

587
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:47,977
That's just because of that, yes that warning is

588
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,582
a good warning. Let's go look at this warning right here,

589
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,017
it says, unreachable part of our storyboard.

590
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:58,188
And indeed if we go look our storyboard over here,

591
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:01,390
here it is. We have no entry point to our storyboard, cuz,

592
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,260
remember, I deleted all of that junk?

593
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,229
Well, I deleted the entry point with it. So let's select

594
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,632
this Navigation Controller, and go over and inspect it,

595
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,403
and say, this is our initial View Controller. So you've got

596
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,540
to pay attentions to your warnings over here, right?

597
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,809
So let's bring our console back up,

598
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,014
make this as wide as possible, run, go back and

599
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,883
take a look here. All right, this time it's running.

600
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,753
So here's our EmojiArt right here, let's go ahead and

601
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,090
make a nice EmojiArt document. How about with this thing

602
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:36,893
right here, and let's put a little bicycle on the road,

603
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,796
right there. Now I'm going to hit save, and

604
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,866
let's watch our console over there. Oops, save, look,

605
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:48,004
there it is. Here is our emoji, it's got the URL,

606
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,808
which is this really, really long Google image emoji.

607
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,376
And then it's got the emojis,

608
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,479
which is an array, that only has one thing, the bike in it.

609
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,982
So let's add another thing, my second favorite thing to add,

610
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:04,087
which is a bee, and save. And now JSON has the bee in it as

611
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:07,824
well. So with very little work here,

612
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:11,060
just by making that thing codeable, we have made it so

613
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,197
we can save our document in JSON format. So

614
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,900
now let's add the file system code to actually write it out

615
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,236
to disk. And that's gonna be our next step here, so

616
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:23,206
let's go do that. Go back to our controller here.

617
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,542
So instead of printing this thing out as a JSON,

618
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,543
we're just going to write this to disk.

619
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:32,315
Now this is of type data, right? It's a data. So

620
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:39,022
I can just write it to disk with json.write[to: url].

621
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,625
Now, couple of things, one we have to say what url are we

622
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,659
gonna write it to. And of course this throws.

623
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,696
So you're gonna have to do both of those things. First,

624
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,332
let's talk about what url we're gonna write it to. Well,

625
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,968
any time you talk about the file system, what's the number

626
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,404
one thing you have to do when you're creating your url?

627
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,273
Find a directory in the sandbox to start.

628
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,675
Always do this. 100.0 percent at a time, you're going

629
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,878
to write something to the file system or read something from

630
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,514
the file system. You gotta figure out which sandbox

631
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,117
directory you're gonna start in. So this is a document, so

632
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,688
I'm gonna put it in my document directory. So, I,

633
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:16,292
let's type this in here. This is how we look up a sandbox

634
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,363
directory here, this default FileManager.default method

635
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,465
url. So we're looking for the document directory.

636
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,301
We always do userDomainMask. We're not replacing a file so

637
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,337
we don't care about that. And we want to create

638
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,340
the documents directory if it hasn't. And then I'm gonna

639
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,176
append the name of my file unto that URL for the document

640
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:37,614
directory. untitled.json, I'm gonna call it. So

641
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,683
now I have the URL. I can put this in here and write it.

642
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,353
Now I just have to deal with the fact that this throws.

643
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,357
So it means I have to put try in front of it. And

644
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,494
I'm going to actually catch errors in this.

645
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:58,035
Catch, oops, catch let error. And here if I get an error I'm

646
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:01,771
gonna say print("couldn't"), oops, couldn't.

647
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,774
Save, and we'll put the error right in there, so

648
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,443
we can see what it is. But, if it doesn't fail,

649
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,881
then I'm gonna say saved successfully.

650
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,352
So, now when we run on our console, we should see,

651
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,222
either, saved successfully, or couldn't save.

652
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:23,426
So, let's go try this. Put all the code on here at the same

653
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:28,431
time so you can see it. Run again. Let's go out here,

654
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,805
see that. So one thing about our app, of course,

655
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,708
every time it starts, we, it doesn't load up the document.

656
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,609
So, it's always blank.

657
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,378
So we'll always have to start again. So here let's start

658
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:47,150
again with this one. Let's put an apple in the sky up here.

659
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,020
And I'm gonna hit save now and hopefully it will say saved

660
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,956
successfully in our console, ready? Woo hoo,

661
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,193
saved successfully! Let's add another one, some coffee.

662
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,196
Saved successfully, it's working. But, this is not very

663
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,966
satisfying because, it's just saying saved successfully.

664
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,102
And you're like, yeah, sure, well you say it's saved. But

665
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,471
did it really save? But actually, we can go look and

666
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,174
see if it saved and go find this document. Because

667
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:15,178
we have the iOS 11 files app, which let's us look at

668
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,381
documents in apps that opt in. Now,

669
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,684
the key there is apps that opt in. So we have to actually put

670
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,754
that little info.plist thing I was talking about that says we

671
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,590
are an app where you can look in our document directory and

672
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,325
see our document. So let's go do that.

673
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,528
We're just gonna jump over to our info.plist here. I'm gonna

674
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,698
do the same kind of thing that we did in your homework where

675
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:39,569
you added a row, remember that, to do the HTTP URL. So

676
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:45,341
I'm gonna add a row, Support Document Browser,

677
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,110
there it is. Supports Document Browser, and

678
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:51,581
I'm gonna set that to yes. And that tells the system, okay,

679
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,416
you can look in my documents directory and

680
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,419
see my documents. So I have to run again because we have to

681
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,789
transfer the app back over to the iPad, so

682
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,525
it'll look at this info.plist over there. But actually,

683
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,727
I don't even need to create that untitled JSON again,

684
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:07,697
it's already there. So I swiped up from the bottom to

685
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,432
get this little thing to appear on the bottom here.

686
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,800
And I'm gonna click or

687
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,302
touch on this app right here. That is the files app.

688
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,539
And you're gonna see the UI here for files.

689
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:20,009
This is a lot what your UI is gonna look like in your app.

690
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,212
So it's got all these nice folders right here.

691
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,814
You can arrange them by date, and tags, and

692
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,817
name. You can go put things on your iCloud Drive. You can put

693
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,354
things on you iPad. And here, I'm clicking iPad. Emoji Art

694
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,257
is the only app On my iPad currently that has a documents

695
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:38,160
directory, with documents that file is allowed to look at.

696
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,163
That's because this iPad is pretty much fresh install.

697
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,000
But here it is, my app. And if I click on this notice it puts

698
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,903
my app icon in, that's kinda nice. If I click on it,

699
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:50,173
woohoo, it's untitled.json. And I can long press on it,

700
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,375
and say info. And it'll even tell me look, this is the kind

701
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,612
of file, it's a*.json file. It has 656 bytes, that sounds

702
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,182
about right. That's about how many things we had in there.

703
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,885
And I can even click on it to view it. However,

704
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:08,057
look where it views it. In some sort of JSON,

705
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,093
viewing app of some sort.

706
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,364
Not in our app, so that's kinda weird.

707
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,733
Why is that? Well, because we're not a JSON viewing app,

708
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,770
we're an emoji art app. So the files app doesn't

709
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,306
know that we are the one to open there. And we can fix

710
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,875
that a little bit later. We're probably not gonna have time

711
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,176
to do it today with the demo.

712
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,679
But I will certainly do it in the code I post and show you.

713
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,882
And the fix to that is to define a new file type called

714
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,651
emoji art. And then the files app will know,

715
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,053
that's an emoji art thing.

716
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,389
But right now, it looks at extension json and says well,

717
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,524
I'm gonna do the json thing.

718
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,926
And you can tell, see it's right though.

719
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,927
It's got the apple, it's got the coffee in there.

720
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,531
It's really small but you can see it. So, that's great. So,

721
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,867
we know it's actually saving. So let's go to the next step,

722
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,969
which is reading this document. So,

723
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:56,305
let's have our app, every time it puts its view controller

724
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,509
up, view will appear we'll do it in, it looks for

725
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,211
untitled.json, and loads it up.

726
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,747
That way, every time we run our app, it won't be blank

727
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,517
every time. It'll just load the last document we were

728
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:10,620
working on untitled.json that we were working on. Okay, so

729
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:16,292
let's do that. Go back to our controller.

730
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,763
Here's our view controller right here. So we're gonna do

731
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:26,869
that in viewWillAppear. super.viewWillAppear(animat-

732
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:31,674
ed). So, what do we need to do in here in viewWillAppear,

733
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,943
to get this to appear? It's pretty straightforward.

734
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:38,314
We just need to get that URL for the untitled.json. And

735
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,185
then look at the data and turn it back into an emoji art and

736
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,752
set that as our model.

737
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,323
Got that, so let's do that. Of course I need that URL.

738
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,994
So I'm gonna do the same thing that I did before.

739
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:54,030
What did I call that, let url, yeah. So

740
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,633
here's where I go get my document directory and

741
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,268
append the path component on untitled.json.

742
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,605
This is exactly what I did up here, no different cuz I want

743
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:07,677
the exact same url. But here, I'm going to say if I can let

744
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:12,515
jsonData equal trying to have Data contentsOf,

745
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:16,986
exactly the same thing. This Data contentsOf is exactly

746
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:20,356
what we did to get image urls over http, right?

747
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,793
So, contents of the file url, which is

748
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,729
this untitled json file in our documents directory.

749
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,399
That's what this url is. So if I'm able to create a data out

750
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,937
of that file, now I need to create an emojiArt out of it,

751
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:38,073
and set that as my model. So emojiArt is my model,

752
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:42,811
let me say equal to. I need to create an EmojiArt from

753
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,950
some jsonData. Well, we don't have an initializer for

754
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,721
EmojiArt that creates an EmojiArt from jsonData.

755
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,823
But we can really easily write one.

756
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,992
Let's go back to EmojiArt over here.

757
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,327
And just like we wrote this to get the JSON,

758
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,629
we can certainly write an initializer,

759
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,698
which I'm also gonna have be failable,

760
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:07,336
that takes some JSON, which is a Data. And, Initializes and,

761
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,807
if I can't initialize it, then I'm going to fail and

762
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,811
return nil. So what does it look like to do this? Again,

763
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,447
really easy. I'm just gonna say, if I can let new value,

764
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,183
that's gonna be my new value that I pull out of there,

765
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:28,190
equal try to JSONDecoder.

766
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,493
And what am I trying to decode out of that data?

767
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:34,730
I'm trying to decode an EmojiArt object.

768
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,200
And from what data? The JSON that you passed in.

769
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,435
So if I'm able to do that,

770
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,871
if I'm able to decode it out of there, now I have it.

771
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,642
The new thing in new value, and so I'm just gonna say,

772
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,044
self = newValue, right? I mean, an initializer here. So,

773
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,581
I'm just going to initialize myself, and I'm gonna fail

774
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,917
otherwise by returning nil. Now, this ones much more

775
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:58,554
likely to fail, because you could imagine corrupted JSON,

776
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,324
just playing the wrong JSON file. An empty JSON file, all

777
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,360
of these things would cause this to fail, and that's fine.

778
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,761
It's just this will not initialize,

779
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,166
this is only gonna initialize. If this is valid about JSON

780
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:13,969
encoded, something from this basically that's the only way

781
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:18,474
it will succeed. So now our code will work over here,

782
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:21,277
right? We've got this implemented, so

783
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:25,414
now when we quit and go back our document should be there.

784
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,152
So let's do that let's run and

785
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,456
then show it to you. Here it is and

786
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:37,226
sure enough look at that, it already picked up that

787
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:41,730
untitled.json and if I add a dog to this and hit Save.

788
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:47,369
Then quit and run again,

789
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,773
comes back with the dog. So we're both saving it,

790
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,109
with the Save button, and view will appear,

791
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,612
we are loading it up. So this is excellent.

792
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,847
We are really making a lot of progress here.

793
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,450
But now it is time to take this to the next level,

794
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,552
which is to be able to do that files app kind of UI. And

795
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:07,423
to do that, to make that easy, and to simplify our existing

796
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:11,694
code actually, we need to use UIDocument. UIDocument

797
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,930
encapsulates a document in just this really beautiful

798
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,900
way, really nice API. And that's what we need to do.

799
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,402
Now we could just do that here.

800
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,204
All you have to do is create a UIDocument subclass,

801
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,174
and implement the two methods I talked about in lectureon

802
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,176
Monday. But this where we're gonna step in and

803
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,146
use that template. We're gonna throw that template in here

804
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:36,319
for document base. So I'm gonna stop my app right here.

805
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:41,390
And I'm going to rename my existing EmojiArt.

806
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:45,094
I'm just gonna call it EmojiArtOLD. And then I'm

807
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,031
gonna go back to Xcode and create a new project. On this

808
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,767
two project I'm gonna use this Document Based App right here.

809
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,836
I'm wanna call this still EmojiArt,

810
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,705
basically this gonna be the same app which gonna have

811
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,243
this build on this template. I'm gonna put the same place,

812
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,545
I put everything else, here it is.

813
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,048
Let's quickly look at the things this created.

814
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:09,184
It's just a normal kind of Xcode app, of course,

815
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,422
it has assets, a launch screen, an app delegate.

816
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,958
And so I'm gonna put these three things in a little

817
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:20,729
supporting file like I always do. However, I'm gonna

818
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:25,701
take a moment to first take a look at the AppDelegate.

819
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,203
Because the AppDelegate is not just a bunch of

820
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,573
empty methods with just comments only,

821
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,975
it also now has this actual method.

822
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,579
This method is called open inputURL. This is sent

823
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,847
to your application by other applications,

824
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:42,618
like files, that say, I wanna open up one of your documents.

825
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:45,154
Now, this is only gonna get called if we have an EmojiArt

826
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,556
document, not a JSON document, cuz we're not an,

827
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,326
JSON opening app. But this is how that happened.

828
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,661
It's pretty simple code, I'm not gonna go through it, but

829
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,231
this is where that's going on. And we're gonna talk all about

830
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,034
AppDelegate, all this stuff, next week, all right.

831
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,236
So we got supporting files. What else came over there?

832
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,940
Well, we have this UIDocument subclass

833
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,608
called Document. Well,

834
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:10,479
this is going to eventually be our EmojiArtDocument.

835
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:14,883
EmojiArt, so you can rename the name of the file to be

836
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:19,488
EmojiArt. So this has got those two functions, right?

837
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:21,691
The one that converts from out model to a data,

838
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,493
and from a data to a model, back and forth.

839
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,861
That's all we have to implement to make this work.

840
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,396
So we'll do that in a little bit.

841
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:30,132
Then there's this, DocumentViewController,

842
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,135
is basically like EmojiArtViewController, right?

843
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:36,072
It's just the stub for a DocumentViewController.

844
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,040
And, of course, we have EmojiArtViewController so

845
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:38,741
we don't need this.

846
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,911
So I am just going to right-click on it and

847
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,413
delete it. So I'm gonna delete this DocumentViewController.

848
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:47,750
I don't need it, I have my EmojiArtViewController. And

849
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,218
then there's this DocumentBrowserViewController

850
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,188
thing right here. This is the subclass

851
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,358
UIDocumentBrowserViewControl- ler. Here's that viewDidLoad I

852
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,928
was telling you we were gonna configure it. Here's the place

853
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:02,264
where we're gonna call this import handler to copy

854
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,100
a template. Here's some other methods that we are not even

855
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:05,902
going to have to touch,

856
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,070
they just get's called when it's time to open

857
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,639
a document. And then there's this one down here

858
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,308
presentDocument, which I'm gonna delete most of.

859
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,912
This is just an internal method that's called from all

860
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,916
those other things that says, present your MVC for this

861
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:24,320
document at this URL. So we'll be implementing that soon.

862
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,021
And then, of course we've got our story board.

863
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,222
Let's see what's in our story board.

864
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:31,127
I'm gonna make our story board look like more like an iPad.

865
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,963
It's a little more familiar to us. Although,

866
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:35,898
our app will work on iPhone, by the way.

867
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,433
After all this I will show you that hopefully,

868
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,537
if we have time. So there's only two view controllers

869
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,607
here in this storyboard, one is this one.

870
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,642
That's the DocumentBrowserViewController.

871
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:50,212
That's the thing that looks like the files app. And

872
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,182
notice that's where we come in.

873
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,084
We arrive into this app there. Then there's this,

874
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,888
this is going to be our EmojiArtViewController.

875
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,156
In fact, I'm going to delete the one that comes in here,

876
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,424
cuz it's just a little place holder.

877
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,227
And I'm gonna put my EmojiArtViewController here,

878
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,662
and lets go do it right now.

879
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:10,899
In fact, I'm gonna go back to EmojiArt.old here.

880
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,801
I'm gonna go to its storyboard.

881
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,938
And one thing that's really cool about storyboards is that

882
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,841
you can copy and paste from one storyboard to another,

883
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,278
because all the connections to the code are made by name.

884
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:23,579
It's only just the names, so

885
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,548
as long as the names are the same in both ways,

886
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,584
places it works. So I'm just gonna select all of this and

887
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:33,155
hit copy. Then go back to my new one here and

888
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:37,292
hit paste. Zoom out a little bit, so I can see it all.

889
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:43,198
Go to our document outline, make this look nice here.

890
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,166
Now, one thing to notice,

891
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,334
I know this is a little hard to see on this screen, so

892
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,369
I'll try and zoom in more.

893
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:50,305
But you notice there's no segue between here, right?

894
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,275
These live on their own, this one lives on its own. And

895
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,278
that's why we have to do this manual presenting. The other

896
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,814
thing I'm gonna do for now is I'm gonna have the entry point

897
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,883
be our existing view controller. We'll add this one

898
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,586
in once we get the UIDocument stuff working, cuz we have to

899
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,123
have UIDocument working before we can really leverage this.

900
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,092
So we're just going to have our old UI for now.

901
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,828
And I'm gonna try and get our existing app as we had it

902
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,663
before working with UIDocument.

903
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,265
So it's gonna be the exact same thing, but

904
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,567
just working with UIDocument instead of directly accessing

905
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,304
the file system there. So of course we also need to have

906
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:25,207
all of our files from the old one. So let's go back to old

907
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:30,378
EmojiArt here. And get all of our stuff out of there, oops!

908
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,916
This, getting these two things on the screen at the same time

909
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,651
on this very small screen can be a challenge, all right.

910
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,658
So I'm going to bring over my controller, my model, my view.

911
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,595
Some of the supporting files like the cells,

912
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,964
the gesture recognizer stuff. The utilities,

913
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,368
the stuff I did, I'm not bringing over the AppDelegate,

914
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:56,271
because that came with the template. So I don't wanna do

915
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,374
that and I'm not bringing over my TableViewController either.

916
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,644
That's what under junk here, that's the TableViewController

917
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,145
that was suppose to be the documents thing, but

918
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,614
we said forget that, we're using this new files thing So

919
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:10,185
I'm just gonna drag these over here. Copy them all in and

920
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,688
one other thing I wanna bring over actually from here is my

921
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,560
app icon. I got this nice app icon, I don't wanna lose that.

922
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:21,630
So I'm gonna go over here to my assets and my new one and

923
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:26,201
get rid of the blank app icon and just drag this app icon

924
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:31,340
over here. So that's it. So I've essentially brought over

925
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:35,644
everything from my old emoji art to the new emoji art. But

926
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,581
what we're gonna do first is go and

927
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,283
make this emoji art document business work.

928
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:43,753
So let's go do that. Where's our emoji art document?

929
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,921
It's right here. This is the thing I just renamed.

930
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,324
And there is only these two methods that are doing stuff,

931
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,659
we know exactly how to do it,

932
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:53,462
we were just doing this. One thing about this is,

933
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,932
is you notice the contents returns an Any not a Data,

934
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:00,069
that's because this Any could be a file wrapper. A directory

935
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,905
full of files is a way to represent a document just like

936
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:06,075
is a data is. But usually this is going to return a Data.

937
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,211
In fact, look, the default returns a blank Data. So here,

938
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,680
to do either of these,

939
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:15,918
we actually need that model passed to us in the document.

940
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,854
So, I'm gonna have a var emojiArt over here as well

941
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,990
which is going to be an EmojiArt. And

942
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,693
any time I wanna save my model from my controller, I just

943
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:28,497
take my controller's model and put it in the document and

944
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,567
then the document knows what to do from there.

945
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,936
So let's go ahead and return this emojiArt.json and

946
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,640
if it doesn't have JSON representation,

947
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,877
then we'll return Data, which is a blank document.

948
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:44,080
Empty document and we know how to deal with that,

949
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,982
because our documents always come up empty.

950
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:50,485
And then this is the other way around, here we're having one

951
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:54,323
passed to us. A data pass to us and we want to turn it into

952
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:57,226
an emoji art. So I'm going to say if I can let the json =,

953
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:59,461
the contents that were passed to me as a data,

954
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,964
because I don't deal with file wrappers.

955
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:05,233
If this were a file wrapper, I don't deal with that.

956
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,336
Then I'm gonna set my emojiArt equal to, again,

957
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,773
using that constructor that I did to take the data and

958
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,408
turn it into an EmojiArt.

959
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,212
And this might fail and that's fine. And this will be nil and

960
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:20,449
then it won't save the document. It can't save a nil

961
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:25,187
document. And, I talked about this ofType in both these

962
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:29,892
cases. This is a UTI. Like public.json is a UTI or

963
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,030
edu.stanford.cs193.emojiart could be a UTI.

964
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,998
A unique identifier of the type.

965
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,102
Now we don't really care because we only open one thing

966
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,171
or anything we open, JSON or an emojiArt or whatever,

967
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,074
is all just a JSON data anyway to us. So we don't care about

968
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,744
the type, but some apps might open multiple different types.

969
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:50,646
They might need to know what type it is in order to

970
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,715
successfully open it or save it. And that's it, this is all

971
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:57,286
we need to do to do an emojiArt document. We're done,

972
00:50:57,355 --> 00:51:00,489
now we can use all the API of UIDocument like, let's say,

973
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,659
synchronous opening and saving, working over iCloud,

974
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,928
automatics, auto saving, all that stuff just all work for

975
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,331
free as long as we implement these things.

976
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,235
So let's use all those things back in our emojiArt

977
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:16,939
view controller here to replace the places where we're

978
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:20,842
actually accessing the file system directly here. So

979
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,513
we want to get rid of this, so let's delete all that. And

980
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,017
let's delete all this. And

981
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:32,254
we're gonna replace this with stuff from using the same

982
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:35,690
primitives, but using the document. Now, to do this,

983
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,560
we obviously need to have a var which is the document

984
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,228
cos we have to be able to talk to our own document.

985
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,665
And so we're just gonna have a var called

986
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,500
document which is a type EmojiArtDocument. This is

987
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:49,938
going to be set in that code from the file chooser, right?

988
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,439
When the file chooser chooses a file,

989
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,875
we're gonna set our document in our new MVC and

990
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,012
then it's just gonna magically show its stuff using all

991
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,648
the document API. So let's talk about,

992
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:03,151
view will appear first. When our first document first

993
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,587
appears, we need to open our document.

994
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:10,091
So we do that by just saying, document?.open. And that's all

995
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,695
we have to say. It does come with a completion handler

996
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:16,064
that will tell you whether it was successful doing that.

997
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,833
And we usually want to check this, and say, if we're,

998
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,303
there were success, then we're going to do some stuff.

999
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:23,639
What might we want to do here, maybe want to set

1000
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:30,912
our title equal to the documents localized name. This

1001
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,749
localized name just come from the URL, it's like the last

1002
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,851
part of the URL without the file extension put in there,

1003
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,386
so that's nice. We need self in there of course to

1004
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,989
insert a closure. But the most important thing we wanna

1005
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:46,361
do if we successfully open the document is to set our model

1006
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:51,567
to the model that the document was able to get by

1007
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:56,438
opening that file. So the document has an emoji art that

1008
00:52:56,507 --> 00:53:01,176
it got from the file. We have our model. We want to get it.

1009
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,212
So that's the main thing we are doing in all of these

1010
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,582
document things, is for setting, getting our model.

1011
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,819
Now what about save? Well,

1012
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:17,259
we actually don't really do save, we do autosave.

1013
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:21,529
So how do we do autosave? The only thing that's important

1014
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,868
with autosave is that you tell the UIDocument that something

1015
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,437
has changed. Otherwise, it's not going to waste its time

1016
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,239
autosaving something that hasn't changed. And

1017
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:36,111
you do that by first telling the document to look

1018
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,849
at your model, so we wanna set it to our model.

1019
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:44,186
And then you tell the document that a change has happened.

1020
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:47,723
So you update the change count and you say that that change

1021
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,593
is done. By the way, this done can be undo, redo or done.

1022
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,728
So we're not talking about the undo manager, so

1023
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,531
I can't really show you that. But the other option is done,

1024
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,333
because meaning the change is done.

1025
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,636
And by the way, I'm only going to do this is the document's

1026
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,140
emojiArt is not nil. Okay, if we haven't actually started up

1027
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,343
a document, it's useless to be updating its change count

1028
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:13,816
there. Now this is strange, because we are saying and

1029
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,084
noting that our document changed,

1030
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:20,522
because the user pressed the save button. That is weird.

1031
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,925
Really, we should notice change when anything changes.

1032
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,494
Someone dragged out another emoji, they resized it,

1033
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,230
they put a different background URL. That's when

1034
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,834
we should "save". And really, this method shouldn't even be

1035
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,069
called save, it should be called document change.

1036
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:37,339
Well, unfortunately, the time, one of the number one thing

1037
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:39,041
it's gonna cut off that I can't get done,

1038
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,509
because of this midterm coming in here,

1039
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:45,079
is putting that saving, or the document change tracking in.

1040
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,182
And why is that an interesting thing?

1041
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:52,086
Well, because that's being tracked in our view, right?

1042
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,957
Our view is what knows when we've resized something or

1043
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:55,958
dragged something in.

1044
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,861
So our view needs to talk back to our controller and say,

1045
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:02,430
hey, something changed. Well, it can't talk back to our

1046
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,400
controller, except for blind and structured, right? So

1047
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,503
how would we, any of you here, how would you suggest that we

1048
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,506
talk from our view back to our controller to tell it, hey,

1049
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:14,510
this document has changed, this document has changed.

1050
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:16,712
What would you suggest, mechanism?

1051
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,154
So one suggestion is, let's have a variable in our

1052
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:29,157
view that's a reference to our controller. And

1053
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:32,060
that's not allowed by MVC, right? View can't talk

1054
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:37,366
to its controller that way. So let's try delegation.

1055
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,035
The same way a table view talks back to its controller,

1056
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,704
it's a delegation, scroll view it uses delegation,

1057
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:45,573
that's how we would have to do. So we are going to set up

1058
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,410
our own delegation where we have an emojiArt view

1059
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,745
delegate. That's what we would do. Unfortunately,

1060
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,314
I don't have time to do that, but that's what we would do.

1061
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,115
So I don't want you to get the idea here that you should

1062
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,017
have save buttons in document apps.

1063
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,719
You should never have a save button.

1064
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,354
It should know when things change and

1065
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:03,091
just call this updateChangCount.

1066
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,627
But since we don't have that, we will have our save button,

1067
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:09,865
we will just tell it when it saves. All right? What else do

1068
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:12,600
we have to do here? How about closing our document.

1069
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:16,004
Right now we only have one document, untitled.json, but

1070
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,606
we're just about to ask, add a file chooser that's gonna let

1071
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,508
us choose lots of different documents. So

1072
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,610
we need a way to close this document so

1073
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,312
we can open another document.

1074
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:29,284
So I'm gonna go back and add a close button to our UI.

1075
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:32,354
I'm gonna put it right here on the other side from save

1076
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:36,525
over there. We're gonna go in here. Bar Button again,

1077
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,862
Bar Button up here. There's actually a standard one for

1078
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,864
that. It's actually called Done,

1079
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:47,068
cuz you're done with this document, right there. And

1080
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:52,106
we are then going to control-drag, and

1081
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,978
I'll put it right in here. And I'm gonna have an action here.

1082
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,713
I'm gonna call it close, I could call it done, but

1083
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:02,851
I'll call it close. And now let's go back

1084
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:08,189
to full width here, go back over to here. All right,

1085
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,093
so what are we gonna do in our close? Well, for a document

1086
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:15,564
app, it's easy. You're just gonna say document?.close().

1087
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,666
Now, it also has a success completion handler, but

1088
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,037
I don't really care because I'm not gonna do anything.

1089
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,471
Whether it's successful or not,

1090
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,907
I'm just going to try to close it, and hope it will be, and

1091
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,476
99% of the time it's going to be. I could, you know,

1092
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,613
catch your errors and stuff like that. Having problems for

1093
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,682
some reason, the closing and having problems, but

1094
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,350
the best we can really do is just try to close and

1095
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,251
see what happens. The other thing I'm gonna do is I'm

1096
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,788
gonna save() right before, now because I don't have automatic

1097
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,892
change tracking, I wanna save before I close. If I had

1098
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,362
automatic change tracking, I wouldn't do save here. I would

1099
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,330
delete this line of code. And in fact I am going to delete

1100
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:52,234
this line of code when I post this code after lecture,

1101
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,369
because I'm going to have that change tracking in there.

1102
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,237
Now notice I did save with no argument,

1103
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,472
because save takes a bar

1104
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,208
button item and I don't have one. Here's a cool trick.

1105
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:01,809
I'm gonna make this an optional and

1106
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,814
have it default to nil. By doing that, now I can call

1107
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,050
save with nothing and it defaults to nil and

1108
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,151
I don't use this bar button item in here so,

1109
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,156
all is well. Everybody got all that? Okay, now,

1110
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,659
to test all of this, this is it. See how we've replaced all

1111
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:20,796
that stuff in our, that was file system now with all this

1112
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,298
nice code that is very understandable and readable?

1113
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:26,602
Open our document, close our document, update the document.

1114
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,238
I'm going to, in my view did load, set my document

1115
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:33,174
to be Untitled.json. Eventually, it's going to be

1116
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,277
that chooser thing, but for now it's going to be that.

1117
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,145
So in viewDidLoad, just a, this is just as a test.

1118
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,780
I'm going to take this right out of here,

1119
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,415
right after we do this test. And

1120
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:45,320
all I'm going to do here is get that,

1121
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:50,092
that json url again. You can see why I put that in,

1122
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,659
those codes in there, because I have to type it so

1123
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,729
many times. And all I'm going to do here is just

1124
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,497
set my document, right?

1125
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:00,302
That's this bar right here. It has to be an EmojiArtDocument,

1126
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,038
I'm going to set that equal to an EmojiArt,

1127
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,242
well we're running out of battery there. Document, and

1128
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:11,713
remember that UIDocuments only have one initializer,

1129
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:16,384
it's the URL. So this is fileURL,

1130
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:22,557
the URL. Make sense there?

1131
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:26,261
Have my close, curly braces, there we go. So that's it.

1132
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,664
So I'm only doing that just as a test. So now,

1133
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:33,535
when we launch our app, it should load that Untitled.json

1134
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:36,104
up because we're immediately setting that as our document,

1135
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:37,739
and the document just does its thing.

1136
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:41,242
So let's go ahead and take a look at that here.

1137
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,713
Run, and let you see what's going on.

1138
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,823
Okay, look, it loaded up Untitled.json. And

1139
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:57,759
let's put a little airplane flying across there, and

1140
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:01,195
I'm gonna hit Save to let it know that there was a change

1141
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:06,801
to the document, and then hit Done. Now if I quit and

1142
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:11,439
run again. Hopefully, we'll see

1143
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:13,975
the airplane there and we did. Okay, so UIDocument is doing

1144
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,177
all of the things the file system stuff was doing for

1145
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,413
us. But now that we have UIDocument,

1146
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,149
we can have our app launch instead

1147
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,151
of launch and show this, launch and

1148
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,420
show that file choosing thing, the document browser thing,

1149
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,222
like the files app. So let's go put that piece of

1150
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,526
the puzzle in here. Before I do anything,

1151
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:34,763
I'm going to make sure I remove this viewDidLoad.

1152
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:37,298
I'm going to take that away because I'm not gonna be

1153
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:41,436
setting my document to this Untitled.json, I'm going to be

1154
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:44,272
setting it to whatever the document view browser

1155
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,110
wants me to have it be. All right, so here we are.

1156
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,578
This is the document browser view controller,

1157
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,414
this is thing where all the magic happens, here.

1158
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,419
One thing we have to do to get this guy in the loop is to go

1159
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,622
back to our storyboard and have the entry point no longer

1160
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:05,993
be our MVC. Instead it's going to be this. And we're gonna be

1161
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,664
responsible from getting from here to presenting this on top

1162
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:12,333
of this to show our documents. So, let's see how we do that.

1163
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:15,770
All right, so let's do all the parts I talked about in

1164
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,840
the slides here. Let's do viewDidLoad. Let's configure.

1165
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:22,744
So, of course, we want or delegate = self, we need that.

1166
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:25,513
Also, we are not going to allow picking of multiple

1167
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,015
items, cuz we only know how to show one EmojiArtDocument

1168
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:32,454
at a time. Allows documentation to be true, hm,

1169
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,224
yeah for now. And then here is things, tint color,

1170
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,059
I'm not gonna change the color or the look of it.

1171
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:40,996
You can play around with that, see what you like there.

1172
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,264
So, we're gonna come back to viewDidLoad and

1173
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,765
address this in just a moment.

1174
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,002
But now let's go down here to didRequestDocumentCreationWit-

1175
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:51,372
hHandler. This is where it's saying, give me the URL of

1176
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,508
a blank document, because someone wants to create one.

1177
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,943
And I'm gonna make this really easy on us here.

1178
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,013
I'm gonna delete all of that in there, and

1179
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,948
just call this importHandler that it gave me.

1180
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,186
See, it's giving me this importHandler? It takes a URL,

1181
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:07,221
and either copy or move. And I'm gonna copy,

1182
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:12,293
call it with a template, which is gonna be a URL, and .copy.

1183
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:19,467
And all I have to do is make a URL, var template: URL.

1184
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:21,936
Make this template point to some blank document.

1185
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:26,707
And I'm gonna do that in viewDidLoad right here. And

1186
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,943
I type that over here. And

1187
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,779
to do that I'm just going to get a URL.

1188
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,147
This time not into my documents directory because

1189
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,350
this is the blank document I'm copying all the time. I don't

1190
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,753
want it to appear in the documents when the guy goes

1191
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:41,856
and looks there. So I'm gonna put it in applicationSupport.

1192
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,125
So, applicationSupport's a great place to put things that

1193
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,928
are kind of behind the scenes. But they're permanent.

1194
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,529
I want this template to stick around.

1195
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,265
I don't want it to be in the caches and get deleted,

1196
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,033
although I probably could put it in caches cuz

1197
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,669
I can always recreate it here in viewDidLoad.

1198
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:56,138
But anyway, so this is the URL.

1199
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,206
I'm going to call it Untitled.json, just for

1200
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,040
old time's sake.

1201
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,642
I'm putting it in my applicationSupportDirectory.

1202
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,712
And all I wanna do here, though, is make sure I create

1203
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,382
this file. So I've got the URL to it. So to create it,

1204
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:11,486
I'm gonna say, if the template is not nil. In other words,

1205
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,389
I was able to create the URL, which I should be able to.

1206
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:18,126
I'm gonna now set allowDocumentCreation.

1207
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,795
This var up here, instead of it being true.

1208
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:23,665
I am going to set it to be the result of asking

1209
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:26,334
the FileManager, the default FileManager,

1210
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:30,371
to create that file. So it has a method called createFile,

1211
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,608
give it the path to the file, the template's path, and

1212
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:35,009
you create it with some contents.

1213
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:37,745
I'm gonna make it empty cuz it's just a blank document, or

1214
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,481
an empty document, and I don't even need any file attribute,

1215
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,184
so let's get rid of that. Now createFile is a nice way to

1216
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:45,353
create a file because it doesn't throw or

1217
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,389
anything like that, and it returns a Boolean whether that

1218
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,659
file either got created or already exists,

1219
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:52,460
which is exactly what I want here.

1220
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,797
And if it's true, then I will allow document creation.

1221
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,131
Otherwise, I'm not gonna allow it,

1222
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,301
cuz I couldn't create the template. See why I'm doing

1223
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:03,905
that right there? So that's a nice little trick to kinda do.

1224
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,840
When you're creating your template,

1225
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:09,377
if you fail to create it for some reason, you can do that.

1226
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,547
So now this importHandler will just work. I'm passing it to

1227
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,383
this template that I created up here, and having it copy

1228
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,386
out of application support into the documents directory.

1229
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,089
These other things over here we don't need to even touch.

1230
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:23,791
These are the things that get called when people click on

1231
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,026
documents, didPickDocumentURLs.

1232
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:29,363
didImportDocument is when some other app, like the files app,

1233
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,566
asks you to open up one of your documents.

1234
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,469
And notice that they are both doing the same one liner,

1235
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,272
which is, please present the document at that URL.

1236
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,008
That means, put up your ViewController to show it.

1237
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:44,545
Okay, so we, and there's a, by the way, an error one here,

1238
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,681
see, failedToImportDocumentAt.

1239
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,316
You really should put up an alert here, but

1240
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,884
I haven't shown you how to put up alerts.

1241
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:51,318
I'm gonna show you next week,

1242
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,988
so you can't do it. But that, you really should put an alert

1243
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,790
that says, couldn't load document, or

1244
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,192
couldn't open document, or whatever. All right, so

1245
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,728
here's presentDocument, that's going to present it. And

1246
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:03,665
I'm gonna basically do what I showed you in the slides right

1247
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,100
here, which is, I'm gonna get my storyBoard.

1248
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:08,870
There was already code to get the storyBoard in here

1249
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:12,206
from that template. And I'm going to use the storyBoard to

1250
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,409
get the ViewController that I want to present.

1251
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,144
Now, it's a little tricky here,

1252
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:19,080
the ViewController that I want to present is actually not

1253
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:22,383
my emoji art ViewController. It's the navigation controller

1254
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,785
it's in, does everyone understand that? So

1255
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,922
I have to somehow instantiate this navigation controller,

1256
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:29,523
which will also bring this in.

1257
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,226
So I need to give this guy a name, so I'm just going to

1258
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,296
select it, go to the Identity Inspector and give it a name.

1259
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:40,301
I'm gonna call it, my DocumentMVC. It could be any

1260
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,671
name we want, but DocumentMVC is kind of what that is,

1261
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,174
at the top of my DocumentMVC mechanism.

1262
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:50,946
So now that I have this name, I can go back here and say-

1263
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:57,285
Let my documentVC

1264
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:03,524
= the storyBoard.instantiateViewCon-

1265
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:11,099
troller(withIdentifier: "DocumentMVC").

1266
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:13,101
So now we have our DocumentMVC.

1267
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:17,038
And now I'm just going to configure it, and then I'm

1268
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:21,508
going to present it by saying present the (documentMVC),

1269
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:25,146
VC rather. And animated: true, I want animated: true in case

1270
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:28,116
someone clicked on it in the file, we want it to slide up,

1271
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,884
right? We don't just want it to just appear,

1272
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,219
we want it to slide up from the bottom.

1273
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,754
There's even a way to make this like grow out of the icon

1274
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,790
in the files thing, which is really cool.

1275
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:36,991
It's not even that hard, but

1276
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,460
unfortunately I don't have time to show it to you, but

1277
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:42,096
just know that there's a way to do it. This is gonna be

1278
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,299
the normal slide up from the bottom presentation. But

1279
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,570
this DocumentMVC has an emojiViewController in it that

1280
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,471
we need to set the document of. So

1281
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,907
I'm going to do the same kind of thing we do in a prepare.

1282
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:57,912
I'm going to say, if I can let my emojiViewController

1283
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,517
= the documentViewController, its contents.

1284
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,419
Remember that contents, I showed you that before, let's

1285
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,255
go look at it just to remind you, I have this in Utilities.

1286
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:12,092
The contents is a UI ViewController method right

1287
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:17,265
here, that just says, if I'm a navigation controller, return

1288
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:20,468
my contents. Otherwise, if I'm not a navigation controller,

1289
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,437
just return myself. So this will make it so

1290
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,639
that this code that I just wrote will work,

1291
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,042
whether it's wrapped in a navigation controller or not.

1292
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:34,282
So get the contents as an EmojiArtViewController.

1293
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:42,257
So, if I can get the EmojiArtViewController,

1294
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:45,860
I guess I should call this EmojiArtViewController just to

1295
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:48,963
be nice there. Then I can set its document,

1296
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,233
EmojiArtViewController.docu- ment = and

1297
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:55,536
what does the document equals? It means,

1298
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:59,106
= a new EmojiArtDocument, which we know

1299
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:03,478
the constructor is fileURL, and what's the URL?

1300
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:08,883
It's the URL they want us to present, documentURL.

1301
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:19,794
This is saying Instance member, capital E,

1302
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:24,566
there we go. I thought it wanted a static method there.

1303
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,603
One other thing we need to do is the types. Right now,

1304
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,540
if we go look at our project settings right here,

1305
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,743
I'm gonna go over and look at our project settings.

1306
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,812
And we look at the info here,

1307
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,683
the Document Types that we can open are images. And

1308
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:47,521
we don't open images, we open JSON files. public.JSON.

1309
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:51,759
And, like I say, when I post the code after lecture,

1310
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:54,762
I'll also do this Exported UTIs down here. And

1311
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,632
make a new type of emoji art, and then put that as our type.

1312
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:02,503
But, for now, we'll say that we do JSON files.

1313
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,972
Okay, so if I haven't forgotten anything here,

1314
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:10,111
it should work. Okay, look at that,

1315
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,246
already you can see that our app is quite different.

1316
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:18,018
It is showing us a UI that looks just like the files app,

1317
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,855
right? It's got the folders and all that stuff,

1318
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:22,724
we can even go over here to iCloud Drive.

1319
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:26,160
We can go on my iPad, there it is, EmojiArt, let's look

1320
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,964
inside. Okay, there is our Untitled.JSON, let's open it.

1321
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:36,470
Woo, it works! Let's close this one, it doesn't close,

1322
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,673
look, I'm pressing Done, it doesn't close.

1323
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:43,311
When our MVC comes up, it takes over the whole screen,

1324
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,746
because we presented it right here,

1325
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:50,118
how do we make it go away? How do we dismiss it, essentially?

1326
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,987
Well, we do that in the ViewController itself, or

1327
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:56,724
the ViewController that wants to dismiss itself.

1328
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,893
And the way we're gonna do that is in close,

1329
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:01,028
when you hit that Done button right there.

1330
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:03,464
And we're going to save, but

1331
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:08,269
then we're going to say dismiss(animated). So

1332
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:11,939
dismiss(animated: true) is how you dismiss yourself.

1333
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:14,642
If you've been presented, you can dismiss yourself.

1334
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,178
This also has a completion handler, and

1335
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,681
in that completion handler, I'm going to close. So

1336
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,250
I'm gonna wait until I've been dismissed. The animation has

1337
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,587
happened, then I'll close my document. And, of course,

1338
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:31,059
now I'm in a closure, so I can say, self. So let's try that.

1339
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,742
So here I'm gonna open Untitled again.

1340
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,576
Now I'm gonna close it and I'm back here,

1341
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,446
now I'm gonna create a document, ready?

1342
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:54,681
Create, it copies that template, it's blank.

1343
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,085
Now I'm gonna drag a document in here,

1344
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:59,953
let's see if we can find something good here,

1345
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:05,158
something like that. Put an apple on the tree, I'd say,

1346
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:10,498
like that. Now, I'm going to, I'll save just to note that it

1347
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:14,368
has changed, again, we should do that automatically. And

1348
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,838
then I'm going to say Done. And now I have two documents,

1349
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:20,574
and now I can go back to the other one, right?

1350
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,711
Click there, go to this one, put that one, now,

1351
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,780
what if want to put these things on iCloud Drive?

1352
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:30,618
Watch what happens when I go to iCloud Drive for emoji art,

1353
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:32,486
Create Document, see, look.

1354
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:34,889
I can create a document on iCloud Drive.

1355
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,958
So this is actually created on the network, I'll be able to

1356
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,461
see on all my devices, so make another one here,

1357
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:45,299
something like this. Put a bee out there, a big bee, and

1358
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:49,703
mark saved, and then Done. And now we have this document

1359
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,140
Untitled right here that you see is on iCloud Drive.

1360
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:55,042
Se still have the Untitled ones on our device, and

1361
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:58,479
we have the one here on iCloud Drive. So, we click on it and

1362
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,380
we get to see it. Now,

1363
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:04,818
the next thing I'm gonna do is make it so that this UI looks

1364
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:09,289
a lot better. Because look at the icons there. I mean,

1365
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,659
is that the world's ugliest looking icons? We're gonna

1366
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,861
go from the world's ugliest looking icons to the world's

1367
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,697
best looking icons. Because with UI document,

1368
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:20,535
you can have each document have it's own icon. And

1369
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:23,303
I'm gonna set the icon to be miniature version of

1370
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,405
the document, a thumbnail image of the document. That

1371
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,275
way I can easily see which one was the one with the apple and

1372
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,543
which one had the bee. It'll be,

1373
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:30,511
I'll be able to see it right in here.

1374
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,381
So let's do that. That turned out to be super simple to do

1375
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,883
in the UI document. So I'm gonna go back to my Emoji Art

1376
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,486
document here. This simple guy. And

1377
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:43,124
I'm just gonna add one method, which I'm gonna override.

1378
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,260
Called file attributes to right. And this is essentially

1379
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,896
just returning a dictionary of the file attribute,

1380
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,799
like is this file hidden, those kind of things. So

1381
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,001
I'm gonna get those attributes from my super class,

1382
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,069
cuz I'm overriding this.

1383
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:58,306
So when you get this and then I'm gonna add one attribute

1384
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,908
which is this kinda complicated thing called

1385
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:03,978
a thumbnailDictionaryKey. Actually the value is another

1386
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:08,182
dictionary. And you put this other key here,

1387
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,618
Thumbnail1024x1024SizeKey. Don't let that fool you.

1388
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,020
It can be any size you want. Although if it's too small,

1389
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,655
it'll use the document icon again. So

1390
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,257
make sure it's big enough to actually being an improvement

1391
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:19,860
on that. And I need to put a thumbnail in there.

1392
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:22,863
So I am gonna add a var to be that thumbnail.

1393
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:26,934
UIImage. Thumbnail's just a UIImage. And

1394
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:29,770
now I'm gonna set this thumbnail image in my document

1395
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,172
every time I close. So

1396
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,007
when I close I am just gonna make another snapshot of it.

1397
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,310
So let's go do that to my controller.

1398
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:41,348
Here's where I close, right after I save. I'm gonna say

1399
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:46,587
that my documents.thumbnail =

1400
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:52,126
myemojiArtview.snapshot. So

1401
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:56,130
snapshot is a little var that I wrote, I put in utilities.

1402
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,665
You can go a look at it. It's only three or four lines of

1403
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,102
code that just takes the view and snapshots it, grabs it as

1404
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:06,107
a UI image. And I'm only gonna do this by the way if,

1405
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,343
again, if my documents emojiArt is not nill.

1406
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,645
Cuz I don't wanna snapshot a blank document.

1407
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:14,615
But what I should do here is do the snapshot and

1408
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:18,552
then if this thing is nil, I should come up with some other

1409
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,923
nice thumbnail for it. But I'm not doing that. So

1410
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:26,861
let's make sure it rebuilds everything here. So

1411
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,598
let's run again. Go over here, see what this looks like.

1412
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,601
It actually ran even though it said it had an error there,

1413
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:38,338
but it did run successfully. All right, so

1414
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,140
let's open one of our documents.

1415
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,175
Remember we set our thumbnails when we close,

1416
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,947
so here's one. Let's go ahead and close it. And

1417
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:48,416
look, we get this beautiful thumbnail of it.

1418
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,983
How about this other one over here?

1419
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,820
This guy? Let's close that one. And this even works on

1420
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,390
the iCloud drive. It might be a little delayed on the iCloud

1421
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,359
drive because it has to upload it, but let's try.

1422
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:01,395
Let's see how fast, pretty quick network right here.

1423
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:03,864
I don't know if you can see in the iCloud drive,

1424
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,767
it actually had the little cloud symbol there briefly as

1425
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,368
it was downloading it back from

1426
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,104
the clouds which is kind of cool.

1427
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,808
In this UI that you see here, is all the full files UI.

1428
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:17,511
So not only can you do things like I did before we check

1429
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,846
the info, but you could move it,

1430
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:23,984
like I could move this from my iCloud back to my local device

1431
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:26,754
or copy here I guess. And it's asking here if I wanna

1432
01:15:26,823 --> 01:15:29,055
keep both or replace it cuz they're both called Untitled,

1433
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,292
so I'll keep both. So now if I go back to my iPad here, now I

1434
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,162
have three items, including this one here. And again,

1435
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:38,432
sometimes you get a delay when you move things from iCloud,

1436
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,834
getting the thumbnails,

1437
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,737
cuz the thumbnails can be kind of big at times. And so

1438
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,806
slogging them around can take a little bit of time here and

1439
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:49,009
there. You can also rename your files, so

1440
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:53,346
you know, this is apple in the sky. So let's rename it,

1441
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:58,418
let's call it Sky Apple. So you can rename your files,

1442
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,488
all that stuff. And the user can do it in here without

1443
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:05,225
having to go over to the files app to do that.

1444
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,160
I have a couple minutes left so I'm

1445
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,164
gonna show you one other thing which is running this on

1446
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:14,068
iPhone. So let's go run this on the iPhone.

1447
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,171
I'm just gonna go run it in the simulator, iPhone X,

1448
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:22,709
let's see what this looks like in the iPhone X. So

1449
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:26,747
this whole document view browser, it all works just as

1450
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:30,551
well in the iPhone, as it does on the iPad. There's only

1451
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,986
a couple of things we have to think about when we try and

1452
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:36,156
make this app work on the iPhone, as you'll see here.

1453
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:39,292
Once this gets fired up. So there it is. See, you can,

1454
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,962
we can look on iCloud Drive here.

1455
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:44,698
We can even see that document, a document that we've created

1456
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:49,469
before on iCloud Drive. And in open end, we can open stuff

1457
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:53,807
off of iCloud Drive. So I can open it. Now On iPhone, I'd

1458
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:57,377
really like to still be able to drag some emojis in and

1459
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:01,115
work on this document, right. One thing I can't do, though,

1460
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,817
is create a new document. Do you see why? Because on

1461
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:07,821
iPhone, you can't drag from Safari to drag in new things.

1462
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:11,591
So it's really misleading that it says Create Document here.

1463
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,694
Because if I hit Create Document,

1464
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:16,196
I can't really create an actual document,

1465
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:19,232
because I can't drag anything in. So I really don't want it

1466
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,336
to say Create Document on iPhone. The other thing is,

1467
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:27,074
I want my collection view to work. I can't drag. I'm trying

1468
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:30,144
to push down and drag. Why does drag not work? Well,

1469
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,746
drag doesn't work because collection view by default

1470
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,982
on iPhone does not allow dragging. But we can turn it

1471
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,485
on. So let's go fix both of those things in our code.

1472
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:41,454
We're gonna fix the problem with

1473
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:45,425
the misleading create by just, this part here where we go and

1474
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,762
create the template. I'm just not gonna do that on iPhone.

1475
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,431
So I'm, that's gonna leave this to be false, and

1476
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,367
So how do I check my code to see if I'm on an iPad? And

1477
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,235
it's not do it.

1478
01:17:55,304 --> 01:18:00,206
you do that this way. You say if UIDevice.current,

1479
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,644
that's my current device,

1480
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:10,383
has a userInterfaceIdiom

1481
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:14,187
of .pad. And the other option is

1482
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,724
.phone so I'm only gonna do this template thing, which is

1483
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:20,527
the only thing that can set this to true on the iPad.

1484
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:23,030
So I'm never gonna have create document on the iPhone.

1485
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:23,831
That's good.

1486
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,233
Now, what about the dragging of the Collection View?

1487
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:29,536
Well, that's in my controller. I'm gonna go down here

1488
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:32,373
to where I create my Collection View. This is my

1489
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,641
Collection View outlets that are here. And I'm gonna set

1490
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,112
this thing in Collection View called draginteractionenabled.

1491
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:43,717
Now this is true by default on iPad. And false by default on

1492
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:45,819
my iPhone. But if I set it to true everywhere,

1493
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:46,854
now it will make it so

1494
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,656
I can drag in my collection vew on the iPhone, as well.

1495
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:53,861
So when we go here, we won't see the create button and

1496
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:57,431
we also will be able to work on our document.

1497
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,071
So let's open this document right here. Here it is.

1498
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:08,408
Now look, I can drag. Drag around my Collection View and

1499
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,910
I can also pull things out of here and

1500
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:14,948
into my picture. I can either mark it as saved and done, and

1501
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,985
if I want it back to my iPad, I'll be able to see it over

1502
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:21,421
there. So the only two things I'm gonna do post lecture

1503
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,957
here that you're not gonna be able to watch me do

1504
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:26,694
is the delegation thing. So that we don't have to

1505
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,362
have that save button anymore cuz we hate that and

1506
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,632
also adding the new type emoji art. Which really is only two

1507
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,769
things I'm gonna change. I'm gonna add the emoji art thing

1508
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:38,805
in that settings that I was telling you about.

1509
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,941
And then I'm gonna change this right here,

1510
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:44,444
my empty template to be untitled dot emoji art. That's

1511
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,281
only change I'm gonna make to make it be using the emoji art

1512
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:52,519
documents instead of JSON. All right. That is it. I

1513
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:55,255
will see you all next Monday. >> For
