welcome to lecture number 8, CS193P, Fall of 2017. Today
欢迎来到 2017 年秋季学期 CS193P 的第八节课。今天

4
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:18,183
it's all about animation, just going to continue a little bit

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,819
of what we talked about Last time. There's three kinds of

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,087
information I'm gonna talk about today.

7
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:25,924
The first is UIView Property Animation. And

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,492
it's exactly what it sounds like.

9
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:31,462
You can animate these yellow properties on your view.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,066
This really the only things you can animate using this

11
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,569
UIView Property Animation mechanism. But

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,370
it's pretty powerfu. You've got the frame and

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,441
center that animating the position of the view. You've

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,343
got the bounds which will animate the size of the view,

15
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,112
although only in a transient way because it's the frame

16
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,816
that determines where you are. And so If you're going to make

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,285
it larger, it occupies more space.

18
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,321
In super view, you have to set the frame. The transform,

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,490
which is super powerful, we saw that with the card,

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,659
where we rotated the corners upside down. So

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,428
you can do rotation, you could also do scaling with that,

22
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,831
in fact, that's probably a better way to do scaling than

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,901
trying to mock with your bounds. And then an opacity,

24
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,837
another good one, fading views in and out, appearing and

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,573
disappearing, and background color. We almost never do

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,476
that, but you could do that. So the way this works is with

27
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,013
a class called UIView Property Animator, not surprisingly.

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,217
And it works with closures. And basically the way it works

29
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,821
is you set a bunch of things on your property animator,

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,791
UIView property animator, to say what kind of animation you

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,227
want. How long it's gonna take, what curve of going

32
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,531
through the process quickly or slowly it's gonna do. If you

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,667
wanna delay before you start. All these kinds of things.

34
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,269
You set that up and then you give it a closure. And inside

35
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:50,041
the closure is just code that modifies these properties. So

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,744
that's it, then it will animate those changes

37
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,214
that you asked for in the fashion that you described.

38
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,651
Okay so, this is a super simple way to animate these

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,754
properties in a view. So let's take a look at what it looks

40
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,124
like to call it now. I'm not even gonna scratch the surface

41
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,794
of UIViewPropertyAnimator's power, it's amazing. You can

42
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,197
create the se animations. You can scrub them backwards and

43
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,833
forwards. You can have them with auto-repeat and

44
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,034
reverse, do all these things.

45
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,004
I'm just gonna talk about the simplest way to use it

46
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,573
which is this class method running property animator.

47
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,844
Okay, this thing creates a property animator that will

48
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,348
immediately start running. Now the arguments to it are very

49
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,351
simple. The first one with duration is just how long this

50
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,919
animation is going to take to happen. So you can make it

51
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,956
a one second animation, or a ten second, solely up to you.

52
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,825
Delay is how long to wait before you start this

53
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,895
animation. Why would you wanna delay the starting animation?

54
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,097
Well, maybe you got some other animation going on you wanna

55
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,001
wait, some time for definition although there's ways to

56
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,771
chain animations too, so that when one finishes,

57
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,973
you start another one, but it might delay for

58
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,542
that reason. Then options we'll talk about later,

59
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,411
just various options, how you want animations to run. And

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,748
then the all important closure right there, animations,

61
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,219
it takes no arguments, returns no arguments this closure and

62
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,120
you just put the code that's gonna

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,522
modify those properties in ther.

64
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,893
And then there's a completion closure as well. This will get

65
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,096
called when the animation actually finishes running.

66
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,331
And that completion one has an argument there,

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,067
which the position's either the start,

68
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,102
because you might be running this animation backwards,

69
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,173
believe it or not. Or it's the end, so the animation got all

70
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,275
the way to the end. Or if the animation got interrupted in

71
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,245
the middle, then the position will be called current,

72
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,182
dot current. This is an enum right here, dot current.

73
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,384
Why would an animation get interrupted in the middle?

74
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,320
You start another animation that animates one of the same

75
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,590
properties. Then that animation wins and

76
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,392
it starts to taking over.

77
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,694
Now you can have multiple of these property animators going

78
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,098
side by side. All modifying different properties, but

79
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,734
once one starts to pick on the properties of another one,

80
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,037
the later one starts to win and take over.

81
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,406
Okay, and then this one will stop, go to,

82
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,310
say it's complete with the current position. Now, there's

83
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,212
something very important to understand conceptually about

84
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:12,016
how animations work. And I'm gonna show you an example

85
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,120
of calling this running property on an, animator. That

86
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,758
closure that you passed to it gets executed immediately.

87
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,762
It does not take five seconds,or ten seconds, or

88
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,797
however long for that closure to execute.

89
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:26,931
It executes immediately and

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,702
takes effect immediately. So, the animation is only

91
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,572
what the user is seeing. The user is seeing your

92
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,409
animation happen over five or ten seconds, but actually it

93
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,344
happened the instant you started the animation. Okay,

94
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,715
so there's a difference going on here. There's the reality,

95
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,618
which is in your code. That all happens instantly, then

96
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,921
there's the presentation of it that happens to the user.

97
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,023
That's what happens over time. So,

98
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,093
this can be confusing because you might have an animation

99
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,361
that you set to take go off in two seconds,

100
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,532
and it starts running for two seconds. And, you know you're

101
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,601
thinking, yeah, my animation, when it's done, my frame or

102
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,404
my center or my alpha will be changed. But no, the instant

103
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,642
you started that animator, it got that stuff changed. So

104
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,176
you have to think about these two timeframes.

105
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,379
This is what makes animation somewhat difficult,

106
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,814
is thinking about them, what we call the model, but

107
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,050
has nothing to do with model view controller. But

108
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,985
you know the actual reality in your code, and

109
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,188
then the presentation which is a different thing if we're to

110
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,689
user seeing.

111
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,923
Alright, so

112
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,427
here I'm going to take a view that's fully opaque and

113
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,830
I'm gonna fade it out, and then when it's gone I'm going

114
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,901
to remove it from superview. So this is basically make

115
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,237
a view disappear from the screen animation. £So first,

116
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,940
I'm just checking to make sure that I'm fully opaque,

117
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,576
if my alpha is 1, then I'm calling the animator here.

118
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,047
This animation is gonna take 3 seconds to fade out, and

119
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,382
it's not going to start Until 2 seconds from now.

120
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,552
That's what the first two arguments mean.

121
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,120
Then I picked one option just for

122
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,021
fun, which is allowUserInteraction

123
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,423
which means that as it's fading out, gestures and

124
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,694
stuff will still work on it. Otherwise,

125
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:06,097
if you don't specify this then as animations happening this

126
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,100
kind of animation, you won't be able to, you know,

127
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,971
tap on things or whatever. Then here's my animations.

128
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,007
My animation is just setting my transparency to zero

129
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,511
fully transparent, right? So, that happens

130
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,280
immediately when I call this method. This method running

131
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,383
property animator return immediately having executed

132
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,253
that closure immediately. And then I have a completion.

133
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,190
If the thing gets to the end without being interrupted,

134
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,493
in other words I do fade all the way out to 0,

135
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,262
then I'm going to remove myself from my super view.

136
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,898
That's what this little completion closure is all

137
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,701
about. But notice I put print alpha equals whatever?

138
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,638
That's gonna say alpha equals 0. Do you see why?

139
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,174
Cuz even though it's gonna take five seconds for

140
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,111
that alpha to go to zero it goes to zero immediately,

141
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,081
because I executed this animation. So

142
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,417
I've said that I'm sure your like yeah makes sense, but

143
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,920
until you start coding it up you're gonna be like woah,

144
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,555
that's right, I already changed that,

145
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,358
it just hasn't appeared on screen, so

146
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,594
you have to get a little bit used to that. What are some

147
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,596
of the options that you can do when you're doing these

148
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,466
animations? The first one, begin from current state,

149
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,835
is if you're animating some property and then you start

150
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,437
another animation that animates the same property.

151
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,473
Does it start from the real value of the property, which

152
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,543
is what it got set to, like alpha equals zero? So does it

153
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,079
jump to transparent and start animating from there? Or

154
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,683
does it pick up from wherever that other animation was?

155
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,353
This is really, do you use the state of alpha that is being

156
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,756
animated or do you use the real state of alpha which is

157
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,458
what's in the code which using our previous slide,

158
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:45,163
would be zero? Okay, so this is kinda like picking up or

159
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,232
just using the real version. We do this quite a bit if we

160
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,134
have overlapping animations that are doing

161
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,272
the same property by two different animations.

162
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,675
What else we got in there? We got repeat and autoreverse.

163
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,442
So you can have animations that can go forwards and

164
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,679
backwards and forwards and backwards.

165
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,780
It's kind of in a loop. That's kind of fun.

166
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,383
Down at the bottom you see these curves. Curve ease in,

167
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,652
ease out. For example, third from the bottom.

168
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,554
That's just saying that when you move the thing,

169
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,989
does it move linearly? That's curve linear,

170
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,825
which would be like it would move like that, or does it

171
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,695
kind of ease into moving slowly then pick up speed and

172
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,432
then slow down at the end? Now why would you want it to do

173
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,637
that? Well things that move like very linearly feel kind

174
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,006
of robotic and mechanical. Things that ease in and

175
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,909
then ease out, feel a little more like someone picked them

176
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,812
up and moved them over and put them down. You see. So

177
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,315
it is just kind of more natural movement. So like for

178
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,585
moving things you almost always want curve ease in,

179
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,188
ease out. But other ones like maybe fading out to alpha.

180
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:49,560
Maybe you don't need that you can just linearly fade out. So

181
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,730
that's it for view animation, super, super easy.

182
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,400
You can only animate those properties. It's super easy to

183
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,403
do. And again, I only scratched the surface.

184
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,071
I showed you one method in UIViewPropertyAnimator.

185
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,007
It has dozens of methods,

186
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,643
lots of capability in there. All right, so

187
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,079
let's talk about a totally different kinda animation now.

188
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,516
This is animating an entire view change.

189
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,452
So you've got a view and it's gonna completely change

190
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,422
the way it looks and you wanna animate that in some ways.

191
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,956
And there's limited ways to do that.

192
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,593
The classic example of this is a playing card. When a playing

193
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,063
card is face down, it looks like the Stanford logo or

194
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,567
it's the back of a card. When it's face up it's got pips and

195
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,268
corners and all of that stuff.

196
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,840
Okay, well when I wanna flip my card over I could just

197
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,875
change it immediately and it would just change back and

198
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,080
forth starkly, but this allows me to actually flip it over.

199
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,915
Like a 3D looking flip. And

200
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,918
you can also cross dissolve from one thing to another.

201
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,454
Those are the two major things you can do here. There's curl

202
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,924
up from the bottom too, which makes it like it's curling up,

203
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,959
and you're looking at a piece of paper behind it and

204
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,627
that's the new version. But

205
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,796
that's only for views that fill the whole screen.

206
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,498
Okay, that's not for, it doesn't really work if it's

207
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:06,771
a view inside another view. It kind of doesn't feel right. So

208
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,574
this is for transitioning just smoothing out or

209
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,744
animating the complete change to a view. Play cards

210
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,913
being the classic example. Here's how you would call it.

211
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,648
You would use this method in UIView. It's a class method

212
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,920
called transition with View. And you give again, duration.

213
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,522
You give the option. Same options as we had before.

214
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,391
Also with some options like transition flip from left,

215
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,027
which means flip this thing from the left edge.

216
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,262
You can also have flip from top,

217
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,231
flip from bottom, cross dissolve,

218
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,201
those kind of things. And now, in the animation block,

219
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,104
you're not limited to just changing view properties,

220
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,706
you can change anything you want,

221
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,041
that's going to make that thing look different. And

222
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,911
then, so what the animation system does is, it draws your

223
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,682
view before this closure. Then it executes closure,

224
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,385
draws the view after, and then it just flips it over or

225
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,222
cross dissolves it, see what's going on here? So

226
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,857
this is kind of a simple animator for big changes.

227
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,059
Playing card is a great example and we'll see that in

228
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,862
the demo that I'm going to do. All right, so that's number

229
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,198
two. Here's number three. This one's a little more powerful,

230
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,400
a little more complicated.

231
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,104
Dynamic animation, it's a little approach to animation.

232
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,541
Here we're gonna set up physics attributes on our

233
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,377
views and then just tell them to go do what they do. So

234
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,548
we're talking physics like density, friction, gravity.

235
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,350
Stuff like that. You put on them there and

236
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,088
then they just start moving because physics, it works. So

237
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,225
let's take a look at how you make this happen. The first,

238
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,860
there's three steps to making it happen.

239
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,628
First, you need an animator.

240
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,364
This is just the thing that drives the animation.

241
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,501
It's an instance of a class called UIDynamicAnimator,

242
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,270
it only takes one argument in it's initializer,

243
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,973
which is the view that is going to be the reference

244
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,076
coordinate system for all animation that's going on.

245
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,712
And the only requirement for this view, can be any view in

246
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,182
your app. It just has to be a super view, or a super view of

247
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,650
a super view, or a super view of a super view.

248
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,319
It has to be at the top of the view hierarchy of all

249
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,055
the views that the animator is going to animate.

250
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,725
But those views don't all have to be in the same view.

251
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,494
They could be in sub-views of other views.

252
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,396
As long as they all are eventually have this view.

253
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,367
The reference view as a super view. So a lot of times people

254
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,436
wanna make their whole view controller's view, and

255
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,970
that's what I'm gonna do in my demo.

256
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,039
Be a reference view cuz I don't have any other views.

257
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,642
But like in your assignment you might just make your view

258
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,077
that contains your cards be your reference view.

259
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,547
Because you're only gonna animate the cards. So

260
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,150
you don't need to go higher level, all right? And in fact,

261
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,286
it's better to stay lower down, because it can be more

262
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,688
object oriented to have that animation code down where it's

263
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,057
actually happening instead of putting everything up in your

264
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,294
controller. But I will say by the way, especially when you

265
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,296
see me do demos, which are really lightweight,

266
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,299
there is a tendency you probably have as beginning iOS

267
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,902
people to put everything in your view controller when

268
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,038
maybe it wants to be down a level in a custom view.

269
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,707
So just food for thought there.

270
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,576
Think about what level things wanna be at. All right, so

271
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,744
number one is to create the animator,

272
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,113
number two is to create behaviors.

273
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:06,583
So this is describing how the things in this view behave.

274
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,519
And so we're talking about gravity, and

275
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,121
whether things collide with each other, stuff like that.

276
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,924
Okay, those are behaviors, and you add the behaviors to

277
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,560
the animator, so animator has an add behavior method.

278
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,697
You call it after creating a behavior and

279
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,534
you just add it. Now as soon as you add that behavior.

280
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,838
That animator would start enforcing that behavior,

281
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,372
whatever it is gravity or collisions or

282
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,175
whatever. But there is no items yet

283
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,843
that are being affected by the behaviors.

284
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,113
So step three is to add items to the behaviors.

285
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,983
So it's creating an animator, add behaviors to the animator.

286
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,852
Now add items to the behavior. The instant you add

287
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,722
an item to a behavior, it will start being affected by that

288
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,092
behavior assuming it's in an animator.

289
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,863
And UIView's are the items here, but actually there's

290
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,433
not UIView's it's any object that implements the protocol

291
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,835
UIDynamicItem, which doesn't have to be a view.

292
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,971
I'm gonna show you that protocol in a second. But

293
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,008
UIViews are 99% of the time what we pass items to these

294
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,278
behaviors. So if I say gravity add item, item 1,

295
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,247
item 1 will immediately start feeling the pull of gravity.

296
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,518
If I say collider at item 1 immediately item 1 will start

297
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,421
colliding with everything else that is added as an item in

298
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,625
collider, in the collider. You don't say go. It's just like

299
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,194
as soon as you add an item it starts being effected by that

300
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,730
behavior. And if you remove an item it instantly stops being

301
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,099
effected by that behavior.

302
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,602
here's that UI dynamic item protocol that view implements.

303
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,102
Okay, so

304
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,973
View actually implemented three of them automatically.

305
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,009
It already had a bound, center, and transform. Okay so

306
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,979
it automatically implemented those. And then the other two

307
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,148
are just really simple things having to do with collisions.

308
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,883
I'm not even gonna talk about those.

309
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,987
But you can see by what's in the dynamic item protocol what

310
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,123
the animation system is Is able to animate.

311
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,227
It's able to animate the size through the bounds.

312
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,896
It's able to animate the position through the center.

313
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,766
And it's able to animate the transform, so

314
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,467
it can rotate and scale and

315
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,537
do anything it wants pretty much in that front.

316
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,041
And it tends to mostly use transform in center to do its

317
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,244
animation. Okay, the bound to be notice is read only.

318
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,214
So the bounds is just for the views that can obviously look

319
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,082
at their own bound from their drawing and stuff.

320
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,987
The animator doesn't actually change the bounds, as it goes.

321
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,123
Mostly doing center and transform. By the way,

322
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,493
if you give an object to the animator by making a behavior

323
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,463
operate on it, really animator kind of owns it.

324
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,397
It owns a center and

325
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,733
transform as it's going to change them around.

326
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,302
So if you wanted to change a standard, or transform

327
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,172
off a view you already gave to a behavior, then you have to

328
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,674
call this method in your dynamic animator which is

329
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,710
update the item to the current state.

330
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,945
In other words, I changed the center or

331
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,015
the transform, please, Mr. Animator, take that.

332
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,684
And so the animator would take that state, move the object,

333
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,487
change its transform, and then start behaving on it again.

334
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,192
Keep going forward, behaving from there. All right, so

335
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,859
let's talk about some

336
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,828
of the behaviors you can have. I mentioned gravity.

337
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:07,598
Gravity is an easy one. By default, gravity is down,

338
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,100
meaning down towards the home button or

339
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,804
the bottom of the device. Like an iPhone 10, it's away from

340
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:17,441
the face recognition stuff at the top. And the magnitude,

341
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,412
we sometimes call it G, but it's not really G.

342
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,984
The magnitude of 1.0 is 1,000 points per second per second.

343
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,519
Everyone knows what gravity is, right?

344
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,322
It's an acceleration, 9.8 meters per second squared.

345
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,724
So, this is 1,000 points per second per second.

346
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,360
Now, what's incredible is 1,000 points per second per

347
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,496
second feels a lot like 9.8 meters per second squared.

348
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,699
In other words, if I put an object at the top of my screen

349
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,170
and added to it a behavior with that gravity, it falls

350
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,873
at about the same rate as a real life object would fall.

351
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:49,973
It's amazing that,

352
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,377
that round number ends up being like that. But it is.

353
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,213
And then also, gravity doesn't have to be down. You can make

354
00:16:56,282 --> 00:17:00,384
gravity go up. Or off to the right or anywhere you want. So

355
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,088
you can completely control what is going on with gravity.

356
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,190
Attachment behavior, really cool one.

357
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:11,963
Think of it as like an iron bar,

358
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,599
or a bar between either two items or between an item and

359
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:20,204
a fixed point, all right? And that bar keeps those two items

360
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,841
connected even as all the other behaviors work on it.

361
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,911
So, imagine you had two things connected with a detachment

362
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,748
behavior. So they're behaving as if they're attached to each

363
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,550
other. And they start to fall because they're both being

364
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,321
operated on by gravity. Then let's say one of them collides

365
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,191
with something. That bark is gonna make it, so

366
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,292
the other one which didn't collide is gonna

367
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,129
swing like a pendulum, you see? Cuz this one came down,

368
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,631
it collided, and this one kept on going. But

369
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,068
the bar keeps them together. And same thing if you attached

370
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,372
it to a fixed point. And then you turn on gravity, it will

371
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,640
start to fall down. But then when it gets to the bottom,

372
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,143
it'll start swinging like a pendulum. And then eventually,

373
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,144
gravity will pull it so

374
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,413
that it's straight down. You see what I'm saying there? So

375
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,350
attachments, awesome, cool little things. Another thing

376
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,854
that's cool about them is you can change the length of this

377
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,924
bar while the animation's happening. So it's animating.

378
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,093
Things are falling, bouncing off, things are colliding with

379
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,529
things. They're attached, and you can make the bar get

380
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,831
closer together or farther apart. You can also make

381
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,400
the bar kind of springy with a certain amount of damping. So

382
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,036
that things hit something, and then it will come together,

383
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,539
and then come back up to make their attachment be the right

384
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,807
distance. It's pretty cool behavior.

385
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,510
Then there's collision behavior. This is probably

386
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,014
the most common behavior. Okay, this is objects UIView

387
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:41,352
bouncing into each other or bouncing off bezier paths,

388
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:45,923
basically, in the background. And you set this up just by

389
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,793
adding any fix boundaries you want as bezier paths,

390
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,129
usually, and then adding items. And you can control

391
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,765
whether the items bounce off each other or only off these

392
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,802
boundaries as bezier paths as you set up. All these bezier

393
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,037
paths are in the reference views coordinate system,

394
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,540
by the way. They're not actually drawn or anything.

395
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:08,278
They're just conceptually boundaries in the space.

396
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,515
And there's a really cool var in there.

397
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,051
The second from the bottom there translates reference

398
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,053
bounds into boundary. If you set that to true

399
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,156
on a collision behavior, then your reference views

400
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,626
outer edges will become a boundary, which is common cuz

401
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,895
you got things bouncing around in your reference view.

402
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,366
They'll stay mostly inside. Now, one thing about collision

403
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,702
boundaries, a lot of people think, if I put my reference

404
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,938
bounds as collision boundary, then no object will ever get

405
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,941
out. Okay, it will never escape. But that's not true.

406
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,478
Because items can, for example, move so fast that in

407
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,147
one animation frame, they move from being on one side of

408
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,883
the boundary to the other. And then they just fly off in

409
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,685
the outer space, they're gone forever. So

410
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,655
collision boundaries, they only check for

411
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,059
collisions on each frame of the animation, and so

412
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,295
they're not a lock down guarantee. You keep things

413
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,164
inside if you put a collision boundary around everything.

414
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,268
Now, collision boundaries also have a delegate. Their

415
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,004
delegate allows you to find out when collisions happen.

416
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,673
So if you set something to be a collision delegate,

417
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,876
you'll get these methods like collision behavior, began,

418
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,412
contact for some dynamic item with a boundary and

419
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,050
an identifier with a name. By the way, notice the boundary

420
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,052
identifiers are of type NSCopying.

421
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,121
That's really weird old Objective-C thing.

422
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,723
That just means that they're either an NS number or an NS

423
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:31,695
string. And so you can use S to turn them into a string or

424
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,931
a double or an int, because we know that NS number and

425
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,002
NS string can be like automatically as to their

426
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:42,906
Swift counterparts there. Collisions are cool.

427
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,043
SnapBehavior, also very common. This is

428
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,612
when you're using the dynamic animation system, how you

429
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:52,349
move something. So you wanna move something someplace else.

430
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,019
You're not doing view property animation here, you're using

431
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,021
dynamic animation, so you say snap to this point.

432
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,257
To little better than the view property 1,

433
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,926
because when it snaps there, it doesn't just jump

434
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,229
right there or even ease out and ease in there.

435
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,331
It actually gets there, and when it's there,

436
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,866
imagine it has four springs on the corner. So it kind of

437
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,137
comes in and vibrates a little. So it feels even more

438
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,607
natural flying across the screen and stopping. So you'll

439
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,777
probably use the snap behavior in your homework because you

440
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,646
have to throw matched cards into a discard pile. You're

441
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,448
probably gonna use snapTo to throw them out there,

442
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,649
cuz you're gonna be doing dynamic

443
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:29,553
animation with them otherwise. Then there's PushBehavior.

444
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,922
Okay, PushBehavior just pushes an object.

445
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,659
And it can either constantly push it. Or it can just push

446
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:39,864
it once, like punch it. And this is an interesting one.

447
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,633
You can specify the angle and the magnitude of the push.

448
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,070
The instantaneous one is kind of interesting, because think

449
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,573
about it. This is a behavior that's added to an animator,

450
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,176
and this behavior only fires once if it's instantaneous.

451
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,479
And then it's just sitting there doing nothing forever.

452
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,248
So it's just kinda croft. So it'd be nice if

453
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,985
there was a way that we could add a PushBehavior and say,

454
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,152
after you fired,

455
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,388
please delete yourself because you've already done your work.

456
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,123
And I'm gonna show you how to do that, but it's gonna

457
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,294
require me to teach you a little more about closures,

458
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:15,332
which I'll do in a little bit. Another one is

459
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,470
a UIDynamicItemBehavior. This is like a meta behavior. So

460
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,372
this is a behavior where you specify things like friction

461
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,376
and elasticity and whether you allow rotation of the view as

462
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,944
it's bouncing off of things.

463
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,680
And this affects how all the other behaviors work, right?

464
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:33,149
If you add more friction, then obviously, gravity pulls on

465
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,552
things. They move slower, because they have friction,

466
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:40,457
etc. You can also ask the UIDynamicItemBehavior about

467
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,461
all of its items. Things like, what's your current velocity.

468
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,596
How fast are you moving across the screen, or

469
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,433
even how fast are you spinning if you happen to be spinning,

470
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,800
how fast is that happening?

471
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,771
So UIDynamicItemBehavior, we almost always have all or

472
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
items in a UIDynamicItemBehavior,

473
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,576
because we wanna be able to set these various things about

474
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,481
them. Then there's UIDynamicBehavior,

475
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,016
which is the super class of all of these behaviors,

476
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,384
collision behavior, gravity behavior,

477
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,453
all of these things. Now, you could subclass this and

478
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,489
try and write your own behavior,

479
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,159
but writing a gravity behavior is pretty hard. A lot of math

480
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,963
involved there, trying to get that to work. But that's not

481
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,932
why you use a subclass of UIDynamicBehavior. What you do

482
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,734
with UIDynamicBehavior is you collect other behaviors,

483
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,404
like collisions and gravity and all this other stuff,

484
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,240
into one behavior. So that you have one behavior that you add

485
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,876
your items to, and it's got all these children behaviors

486
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,812
that are making it behave in all this way.

487
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,613
We're gonna do some of the demo as well, and

488
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,883
the way you do this is you call addChildBehavior

489
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,453
on yourself if you're UIDynamicBehavior sublass. And

490
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:48,658
it now causes that behavior to be your behavior. So

491
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,162
very simple. UIDynamicBehavior also has

492
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,232
a bar in it called dynamic animator.

493
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,669
That is the animator you are currently being animated by,

494
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,605
if any. Okay, so you can look at this to find out.

495
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,940
Am I currently being animated? This behavior or

496
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,144
is it not being animated? And if it is being animated,

497
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,012
who by? And it will even send you a message.

498
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,982
Will move to animator when you switch to a different

499
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,251
animator. Usually when you go from not being animated

500
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,221
to being animated or vice versa, all right?

501
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,525
Now UIDynamicBehavior has another awesome

502
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,094
var that you inherit when you create a subclass or

503
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,062
when the subclasses are created.

504
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,532
Which is action. So action is a closure. Takes no arguments,

505
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,070
returns no arguments. This closure gets executed every

506
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:39,076
time this UIDynamicBehavior Acts. So like a push behavior

507
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,546
that's instantaneous, this gets called once. Cuz only

508
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,615
once does it act on object. But a collision behavior is

509
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,686
kind of always acting on the outer gravity behavior always.

510
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,921
So it's this thing is getting called a lot.

511
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,124
So never put any code in there that takes a long time to

512
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,327
execute because it will slow your animation right way down.

513
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,529
Cuz these things are being called all the time,

514
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,932
these action closures right here. But

515
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,634
they can be kind of useful. For example, you might wanna

516
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:08,304
check in here how's my view left the building, right?

517
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,908
You could look at whatever the items of this behavior's

518
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,043
acting on and did it cause this thing to go outside

519
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,879
the reference bounds even? Or whatever,

520
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,581
so that I have to put it back or maybe destroy it, or

521
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,217
something like that. So again, it only takes a couple

522
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,753
lines of code to check the bounds of your item against

523
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,890
the reference bounds and see if anything has happened.

524
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,526
So that would be okay to put in your action.

525
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,128
Now we're gonna use this action thing in a second to

526
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,366
fix that push behavior problem to, all right? Finally,

527
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,903
I'm gonna talk about stasis of the animator. Really,

528
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:43,273
most of the time we design these animation mechanisms,

529
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,442
with all of the gravity and collision boundaries and

530
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,577
physics and all that stuff, we design it in a way that we

531
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:51,248
expect it to come to a stop. Okay, and

532
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,784
then maybe a push happens, and it goes back active again.

533
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,220
And then it eventually comes to a stop. Most of the time,

534
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,254
it's not required. You could have things just constantly

535
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,591
going around all the time. But usually you push,

536
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,995
whatever comes to a stop. And so you can find out when it

537
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,364
reaches stasis with the UIDynamicAnimator's delegate

538
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,602
which has these two methods. Did pause and will resume.

539
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,103
And it will tell you, I came to stasis.

540
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,873
I'm not currently moving anything and

541
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,975
then something happens. It'll say I'm resuming because I

542
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:24,747
have to move things. Okay, all right? Let's go back and

543
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,483
talk about that push behavior thing. So what I really wanted

544
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,920
to do something like thing. I got this push behavior, right?

545
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:33,223
I set it's magnitude and its angle. But I really want that

546
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:37,427
push behavior to get thrown away as soon as it pushes

547
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,630
because it's instantaneous. You see here, my thing here is

548
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,300
instantaneous. Push, so it's only going to push once.

549
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,135
And then I want it to get thrown away, so

550
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,537
it doesn't muck up the heap with a totally useless

551
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,672
behavior, all right?

552
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,440
Well, I can do that with this action method,

553
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:53,109
the yellow part right here. So I can just have the push

554
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:57,314
behaviors action all behaviors inherit this action closure.

555
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,951
And inside the closure I can tell, ask the push behaviors

556
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,055
animator, please remove me. Okay, remove behavior.

557
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,592
The push behavior itself. So that's cool, right?

558
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,029
It solves the problem. Well yeah, but red on the slides.

559
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,434
This creates a memory cycle. So we're gonna talk

560
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,737
a little bit about this memory cycle that this creates. And

561
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,340
the bottom line here is that the push behavior is pointing

562
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,274
to that closure.

563
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,010
That closure is pointing back to the push behavior.

564
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,381
So both of them have a pointer to something them in the heap.

565
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,984
And so they're both being kept in the heap. All right, so for

566
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:36,520
me to tell you how we're gonna fix that memory cycle,

567
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,489
I'm gonna have to take an aside here and go back and

568
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,224
teach you a little more about closures. Hopefully,

569
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,359
you've read about this in your homework assignment. But

570
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:46,429
here we go. You can define. When you have a closure

571
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,032
you can define some local variables.

572
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,400
Fun little local variables.

573
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,836
You put a little square brackets with these local

574
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,805
brackets in there right before you're in with your closure

575
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,974
and you can define any variables you want.

576
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,943
And you can set them to have some initial value. So

577
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,446
here I have variables x and y. And I can use x and y inside

578
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,616
my closure. And then I'll have whatever value I set there.

579
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,286
It doesn't seem like it's of very much use.

580
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,488
And you're right it's not because, of course,

581
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,223
I could use some instance of a class, or

582
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,125
I could just type hello inside my closure.

583
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,827
Why do I need to have the silly little variables there?

584
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,497
Well the reason they're not so silly is because they can be

585
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:26,170
declared weak. These x and y are different variables.

586
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,238
They're local variables just for the closure. And

587
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:32,176
if you were to declare one of them weak, then it now becomes

588
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,711
an optional, first of all. Because we know all weak

589
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,314
variables, they don't keep things in the heap. And they

590
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,116
also have to be weak because if the thing they're pointing

591
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,986
to goes out of the heap they get set to nil, right?

592
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,622
So I can now use x and y still inside there but

593
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:49,559
x is now optional and weak. Okay, and you're gonna see why

594
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:53,430
that's valuable in a second. I can even declare that those

595
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,033
variables be unowned. And if you remember back to the thing

596
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,368
when I was talking about memory management,

597
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,370
unowned means it's not reference counted.

598
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,238
It's like Swift says okay,

599
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,275
it's on you. If you are gonna access that thing, it better

600
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,111
be in the heap because if it's not, you're crashing. That's

601
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,882
basically what unowned means. So that means I can use x and

602
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,484
y inside the closure. It's not an optional, don't

603
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,620
have to worry about that. But if I use x in there and

604
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:22,091
it's not in the heap, it's gonna crash my app. Okay, so

605
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,361
why is it valuable to do weak and unowned? Well because weak

606
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,331
and unowned variables, whether they're these little locals or

607
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,234
not, don't keep other things in the heap.

608
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:36,006
They're not strong. They're weak or even unowned. So

609
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,574
we can use that to break these memory cycles.

610
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,810
So here's another example of a memory cycle that happens

611
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,413
all the time. Have a class here, Zerg, it's called.

612
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,784
It has a var called foo which whose value is a closure.

613
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,454
Inside that closure, I've set it to have a value of

614
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,891
a closure that calls another function in Zerg,

615
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,762
which is bar. This is a memory cycle. And this is a memory

616
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,633
cycle because foo, the closure, is repressing self.

617
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,301
Self is keeping the class Zerg, the instance

618
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,838
of the class Zerg, in memory. And of course, Zerg is keeping

619
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,907
the closure in memory cuz it has a var that points to it.

620
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,709
So they're pointing to each other and

621
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,545
keeping each other in memory. So that's bad.

622
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,713
You got one pointing to the other,

623
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,481
the other points to the other, so

624
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,217
how are we going to break this cycle?

625
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,854
Well, we're gonna use those little local variable hoo-has.

626
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,990
So I'm gonna create a little local variable. It's weak.

627
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm gonna call it weakSelf. I'm gonna say equal to Self.

628
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,131
And then inside, I'm gonna say weakSelf, question mark,

629
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,200
meaning optional chaining, .bar. So

630
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,004
now there's nothing inside that closure, no variable in

631
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,640
that closure is keeping a strong pointer to self.

632
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,276
And so it's not keeping itself in the heap. Do you agree?

633
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,445
Right, the only thing that's even used inside that closure

634
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,616
is weakSelf, but we know that weak. Can't keep something in

635
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,751
the heap. Now, unfortunately, it's an optional, so

636
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,387
I have to optional chain, but I've broken the cycle.

637
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,224
So this is how we break these cycles using weak little local

638
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,727
variables in our closure. By the way, we are allowed to

639
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,031
call that weak self, self. In other words, it can have

640
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,902
exactly the same name as a variable in the outer scope.

641
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,170
So on this slide, there's two different selfs.

642
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,706
There's the yellow self. That's a local in the closure.

643
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:17,874
And there's the green self.

644
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:22,078
That's the more global self of the instance of this class.

645
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,246
Okay, so it's two different variables. But

646
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,682
I'm not using the green self inside the closure at all.

647
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,284
I'm only using the yellow self. And that one's weak. And

648
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,154
in fact, this is so common you don't even have to say equal

649
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,223
self. If you say weak self, it will automatically set it

650
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,993
equal to a variable of the same name in the surrounding

651
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:41,698
code. Okay, so this is how we break these cycles.

652
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,500
So now let's go back to UI push behavior and

653
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,602
look how we would use unowned. All right, so

654
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,306
here's my push behavior code. If I take that same thing,

655
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,842
that action, and just say unowned push behavior in that,

656
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,013
I've broken this cycle. Because now pushBehavior is no

657
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,648
longer managed by the reference accounting system

658
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,584
and, but pushBehavior better be in the heap right here.

659
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,620
Okay, if it does it in the heap, we're gonna crash. But

660
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,123
of course, pushBehavior is gonna be in the heap there.

661
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:10,160
pushBehavior couldn't possibly even be executing here. It's

662
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,430
action could not be executed if it wasn't in the heap. So

663
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,266
we're guaranteed that that pushBehavior's gonna be there.

664
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,970
So this is a classic one where we would do unowned to break

665
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,605
the cycle. We could've also done week there and

666
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,408
maybe checked to see if it was nil. But it's all unnecessary

667
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:28,845
cuz we know that's never gonna be nil there. It's never gonna

668
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:35,051
not be in the heap.So now I'm going to do a demo.

669
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,520
We're gonna take the playing card thing we did last week.

670
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,122
And I'm gonna make lots of playing cards.

671
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,190
And we're gonna put them in motion,

672
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,060
and have them flipping over, and all kinds of fun stuff.

673
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,928
Friday, I'm not gonna get back to the slide.

674
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,663
So let me tell you that Friday,

675
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:50,333
we will have a Friday section. It's on source code control.

676
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,434
So don't miss that one, that's a good one.

677
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,003
That's the thing we're always not clicking when we create

678
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,973
new projects that say, do you wanna manage this? Connecting

679
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,176
your code to GitHub and all that stuff is part of that.

680
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,112
Next week, actually, I say these, but actually,

681
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,013
we'll definitely do view controller lifecycle.

682
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,816
But I'd probably gonna do multi-threading next week,

683
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,285
which is an important topic.

684
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,753
And then maybe some miscellaneous other UI things,

685
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,190
like scroll view, text field, things like that.

686
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,325
Probably do table view and collection view, and drag and

687
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:21,697
drop, even, the week after that. All right,

688
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:26,469
so I told you I would show you the homework animation thing,

689
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:31,608
so let me do that. Let's go do it here, where is it?

690
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,445
Okay, so again, I'm only gonna show you this briefly. But

691
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,114
I just wanted to give you an idea of what you're gonna do.

692
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,384
Your set app, when it comes up, is going to automatically

693
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,620
deal out the cards. You see how I'm dealing out the cards?

694
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,654
They're flying out, and

695
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,989
they're also flipping when they get there.

696
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:52,362
When I deal new cards, you see, it's smoothly animated

697
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,998
to smaller cards, you see? And then dealt out new cards, so

698
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,035
you're gonna have to do that. Notice, I only have diamonds.

699
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,737
That's cuz I wanna get closer to the end game faster.

700
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:01,938
This is debugging thing.

701
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,775
Also, any three cards are a set right here. So we do this.

702
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,677
Now see what happens when you get a set?

703
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:11,214
They go chaos, they just fly all over the place. But

704
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,983
then they eventually collect over here in my discard pile.

705
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,552
See, look, watch this again.

706
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,653
See them flying all over the place? And notice,

707
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,223
it's also dealing out new cards to replace them.

708
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,991
Eventually, I'll get towards the end here.

709
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,193
There won't be any new cards.

710
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,795
Notice that my deck nicely disappeared. That's not

711
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,531
a required task, but you probably wanna do that. And

712
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,501
then, of course, as my number gets smaller, you're still

713
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,540
doing the chaos animation. And we're rearranging the cards as

714
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,243
they go down. Understand what we're doing?

715
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,511
So you're basically doing three animations there.

716
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,048
One is you're dealing the cards out and flipping them.

717
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,017
Another one is, when cards match, you're exploding them.

718
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,286
And then putting them in the discard pile. And

719
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,323
then every time the number of cards changes, you're smoothly

720
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:57,360
animating to the new number. You're not jumping them.

721
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:02,565
That's it, all right, that's it. So the demo for

722
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:07,670
today, which will hopefully help you, let's go here.

723
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,539
All right, so the demo that we're gonna do today,

724
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,810
which will help you with your homework, is to take our card

725
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,880
app and put these cards in motion. Now this is pretty

726
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,716
much the same exact card app we had last time.

727
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,784
Except that the difference is we used to have one card in

728
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:26,522
the middle. In this case, I've created 12 cards. And

729
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,360
I've used my viewDidLoad to make them be random cards. I'm

730
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,997
just randomly going through, creating these cards, face up,

731
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,267
putting the rank and suit on them to create random cards.

732
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,635
So let's see what this looks like.

733
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:49,679
All right, there's my random cards. They don't do anything.

734
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,646
I don't have any gestures on them.

735
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,716
So I can't tap on them or do anything. So the first thing I

736
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,619
wanna do is add a tap gesture that flips them over.

737
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:57,753
And we're gonna start this app and

738
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,188
flip them over without animation.

739
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,824
Then we'll add animation to have them flip, all right?

740
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,627
So let's do that. I also heard there was some confusion in

741
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,863
office hours about gestures.

742
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,433
So this'll be a good opportunity to review gestures

743
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,002
again. So what I'm gonna do here, first of all, I'm gonna

744
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:16,072
start my cards face down instead of face up. And then

745
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,941
I'm just gonna add a gesture recognizer to them all.

746
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,444
add, let's make this code big so

747
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,414
you can really see what's going on here, right?

748
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:29,052
So I'm gonna addGestureRecognizer, oops,

749
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,822
gotta add it to a view. So I'm gonna add my

750
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:37,994
cardView.addGestureRecognizer, hello. How come, there we go.

751
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,630
So I'm adding a gesture recognizer. The gesture

752
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,767
recognizer I'm gonna add is UITapGestureRecognizer. And

753
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:48,104
then just to review what the arguments are to a gesture

754
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,072
recognizer, there's the target.

755
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:54,544
This is the object that's going to be sent this action

756
00:36:54,612 --> 00:37:00,616
method when the gesture happens. So I'm gonna have

757
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:04,019
the target of this be myself, the view controller. But

758
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,690
it could be the view, I could send it to that view as well.

759
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,926
And this selector is just #selector.

760
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:15,365
And then inside here, you put the name of the method.

761
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:19,202
But only the external names of the arguments.

762
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,439
So, for example, I'm gonna do flipCard. And it's only

763
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,874
gonna have one argument, which is the tap gesture.

764
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,043
And I'm gonna have it have no external name, so

765
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:31,514
I'm gonna do_:. So this is the name of the method with

766
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,650
all the external names and colons in there, but

767
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:39,522
nothing else. That's all, everybody cool with that? Now,

768
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,326
This is just complaining cuz I haven't defined flipCard.

769
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,330
So now when I create flipCard, of course, it has to be objc.

770
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,499
Okay, all these things that do this action thing have to

771
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:54,570
be objc. Call it flipCard, has no external name.

772
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,842
It's gonna be the recognizer UITapGestureRecognizer.

773
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,115
Recognizer, sometimes it makes me type it all in.

774
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:10,085
See if that gets rid of our warning here.

775
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,958
Okay, what's it saying here? What do we, the objc func,

776
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:20,062
how about that? It's rebuilding here. Okay,

777
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:25,501
good, that's fixed, are we over here?

778
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,238
Did I forget something here? Okay, good,

779
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,342
code's a little slow to keep up with my typing today. Okay,

780
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:37,713
so now I have this recognizer. Now I want to just find

781
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,217
out which card was clicked on, and then flip it over.

782
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,154
And this is something that I think people are like,

783
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,656
how do I do that? And the answer here, of course,

784
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:50,326
I'm gonna switch on the recognizer.state. We almost

785
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,962
always switch on the state. That's the first thing we do.

786
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,899
It's a tap gesture, so I only care about the ended state.

787
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,968
All the other states, I'm just gonna break, right?

788
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,572
But if I get a tap, what I wanna do is get the card

789
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
that was tapped on. But I'm in my view controller.

790
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,310
Now normally, I might have the target have been the view so

791
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:10,113
it would know that it was itself that got tapped on.

792
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,480
But here, I'm in the view controller, so

793
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,349
I have to find it. Well, it turns out,

794
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:17,019
TapGestureRecognizer, it knows what view it was tapped on.

795
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,922
Remember how I said each of the concrete gestures

796
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,791
have information about what happened? Well,

797
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,060
one of the things is they know what they were tapped on or

798
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,997
whatever. So I can say, for example,

799
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:34,203
if let the chosenCardView = the recognizer's view.

800
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,272
So view is a var in TapGestureRecognizer,

801
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,708
which is the view that was tapped on. This is maybe

802
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,311
the piece some of you didn't get from the doc. As

803
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,049
a PlayingCardView. Now why do I need it as PlayingCardView?

804
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,185
Because this is just a UI view, of course.

805
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,220
TapGestureRecognizer doesn't know anything about

806
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,756
PlayingCardView. So I have to make sure it is, in fact,

807
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,825
a PlayingCardView. It should be because that's the only

808
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,595
thing that I added any of these tap gestures to. Then I

809
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:03,732
can take the chosenCardView here, and have it isFaceUp.

810
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:09,605
=not the chosenCard view isFaceUp. So I'm just flipping

811
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:14,209
the card over here, right? Everybody understand that?

812
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,746
Okay, so let's go ahead and run and see if this works.

813
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,620
Okay, so they're all face down, that's good.

814
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,955
See I changed them all here to be false. So let's click,

815
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:29,826
all right. Flipped it over, working nicely, okay.

816
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:33,896
But of course we want this to be animated. And

817
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,166
we know that that is really easy to do with that UI view

818
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:42,071
transition with a view thing. So how do we do that,

819
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,707
how do we get started on that? Let's just go right here and

820
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,644
surround this and put this in a closure that's in

821
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:52,482
a UIview transition, so UIView.trasition.

822
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,282
By the way be careful,

823
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,519
their is two different UIView transitions. There is with

824
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,522
right here, which is the one we want and there is from to.

825
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,491
The from to is when you're transitioning from one view to

826
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,194
a completely different view. And you're going to remove one

827
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,596
from the superview and add the other one in as a subview. So

828
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,831
it's a similar thing, but

829
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,267
it's like card where the back of the card goes one view and

830
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,436
the front of the card is a different view. But

831
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,070
here we're transitioning with the same view,

832
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,872
cuz we can turn it face up and

833
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,042
face down. Here I'll go ahead and spread this out so

834
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:23,446
you can see these arguments a little more clearly, right.

835
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,382
Okay, the arguments, it seems like there's a lot of

836
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,251
arguments here but they're all quite simple.

837
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,555
So the view we're flipping is the chosenCardView of course,

838
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:37,159
all right? The duration, I find like a half a second,

839
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,530
maybe six-tenths of a second is a good amount of time

840
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,399
to give it to flip over. Any slower and it feels kind of

841
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:46,001
glacial. Any faster and it's like, what happened there?

842
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,270
It kind of flashes at you,

843
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,838
so you know. Options, here's where we have to say that we

844
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,941
want to flip as opposed to cross dissolve or anything.

845
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,578
So I'm gonna make transition, flip from, let's flip from

846
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:58,914
the left. So we gonna flip from the left. Here's

847
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,717
the animation's closure, okay this is where we're going to

848
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,053
do whatever cause is the view to look totally difference.

849
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,523
So, in our case it's this code right here,

850
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,626
put this inside here. Don't need that way over there.

851
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,961
But and then completion, for

852
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,296
now we're not gonna do anything when it completes.

853
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,933
So I'm just gonna take the completion thing completely

854
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,202
out of there. And we'll put this down here,

855
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,974
whoops, Ctrl+I just to make things a bit neater there.

856
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,177
Okay, everyone got that? So here's our transition.

857
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,280
With this view, flip from left, we're just going to flip

858
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:41,223
the card over. Let's give it a try. Okay, here we go. Woo,

859
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,159
see, and look, see, how it kind of shades a little bit.

860
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,729
The shading, the kind of gray that gives it that 3D effect.

861
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:52,134
It feels a little more like a 3D flip. And it flips it over.

862
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:56,139
Okay, so that was easy. So that's transition animation,

863
00:42:56,207 --> 00:43:01,811
totally trivial. Let's we're not really going to make our

864
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,613
app here into a concentration app.

865
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,283
We're kinda doing a little bit of a UI study here, but

866
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:10,119
what if we wanted this to be like concentration

867
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,855
where we're trying to find two matching cards? Okay, but

868
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,357
we're going to make ours a little bit harder.

869
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,492
We're going to make it so that when you flip over a card,

870
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,162
so here is this card flipped out. If I flip another card,

871
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,130
if they don't match it's gonna go like this,

872
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,632
flip and then immediately flip them back down.

873
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,901
Hm, so you really are going to have to concentrate. Okay,

874
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,504
this really is concentration cause they go clip, and

875
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:31,006
then flip, didn't match. You see?

876
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,242
So we're gonna have to really watch what we're doing here.

877
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,744
So let's add that animation, that just turns cards down.

878
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,046
Any time there's two cards up, we're gonna turn them down.

879
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,650
So to do that, I need a little private var that tells me what

880
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,287
my faceUpCardViews are. Which is gonna be an array of

881
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:50,760
PlayingCardViews here. And I'm going to have it be computed.

882
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:55,931
And we know how to use filters and all that stuff, so

883
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,103
I'm going to have my face up cards be my cardViews,

884
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:04,339
return my cardVews filtered and

885
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:10,445
the filter is that they are face up, right? Let's also

886
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,716
make sure that they're not hidden. Because I'm gonna be

887
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,485
hiding cards that are already matched a little bit later.

888
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:20,623
So I just don't forget we'll make that be hidden.

889
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,061
So now we're able to find out what our face up cards is.

890
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,566
So now what I'm going to do is after this flip over finishes,

891
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,269
I'm going to add a completion handler.

892
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,904
Okay, completion, which I didn't have before,

893
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:41,377
I'm adding it. This one has finished. It doesn't have

894
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:45,414
the position, end, start, current. It just has finished,

895
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:48,751
yes or no, whether this flip finished. Because, it doesn't

896
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,187
really make sense to move your flip backwards and forwards.

897
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,123
It kind of either happens or it doesn't. So inside here,

898
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,326
I'm gonna do another transition. Okay so

899
00:44:57,395 --> 00:45:00,196
actually I'll just copy and paste why not. Copy, paste and

900
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,766
it's perfectly fine to have animations in the completion

901
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:08,003
handlers of other animations. That's perfectly fine.

902
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:08,871
So what am I gonna do here?

903
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,674
Here I'm gonna flip down all the face up cards

904
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,543
if there's two. So let's go ahead and check,

905
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,413
if my faceUpCardViews.count == 2, so

906
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:21,217
I've got 2 face up cards. Then I'm gonna flip them all face

907
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,154
down using another transition. So let me show you a cool

908
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:29,325
way to do for loops if you have an array. Watch this, and

909
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,094
see here, what it's saying? Let's stop and look at this.

910
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:35,497
I got an error here, it says Reference property in closure

911
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:40,736
requires explicit self to make capture semantics explicit.

912
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,405
Okay, this is awesome.

913
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:45,074
Swift if saying, wait a second here bud,

914
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,776
you are accessing a bar on yourself,

915
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:51,013
and that's gonna capture yourself. And

916
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,050
I want you to type, self., right there, so

917
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,319
that you realize that you might have a loop here,

918
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,923
a memory cycle. So isn't that cool Swift made us do that.

919
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,457
I really appreciate that Swift does that.

920
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,493
Cuz otherwise it could be really easy to forget.

921
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:08,030
Oops, this is self and then realize, I got a memory cycle.

922
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,499
But do we actually have a memory cycle here? No,

923
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:15,004
we don't, because while this closure does capture self.

924
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:19,241
Self does not in any way point to this closure.

925
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,910
It's not part of any var. It's not any part of a dictionary

926
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,080
or an array or anything that self has.

927
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,882
It's a closure we're giving off to the animation system.

928
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,218
So only the animation system has a pointer to it. So

929
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,521
there's no cycle here. So there's no reason for us to do

930
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,791
any of those weird local variables that are weak or

931
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,161
any of that. All right so, if I have two face cards,

932
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,697
I'm gonna do a for loop of all the face cards, but

933
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,232
I'm going to do it like this.

934
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,804
Watch this, Face up cards, forEach, do a closure. So, I'm

935
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:52,641
going to execute a closure for each of these face up cards.

936
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,843
So, that is kinda a cool way to do for loop, and

937
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:58,414
inside there I'm gonna put this here. And of course in

938
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:03,618
the for each $0 is each of the things in this so I'm gonna

939
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,623
do this flip transition with each of the cards in here.

940
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:12,127
Same thing same thing. Here's it's $0 is face up and

941
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:18,434
it's not flipped over, it's false. We want them face down.

942
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:23,672
You got all that? Make sense? What do we got here?

943
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:28,444
Let's get rid of this right here also. And

944
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:33,883
what's happening here? $0 is face up.

945
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:42,991
Okay, anyone see what I'm doing wrong there? Look at my

946
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,496
card here, cardView, maybe I need to do this, cardView in.

947
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:54,803
Oops, cardView or something

948
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:59,675
like that. That fix it, yeah that did, that's interesting.

949
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,877
So the $0, I couldn't get it to type right there.

950
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:05,747
I don't know why it couldn't infer that Here, if

951
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:09,485
we have two cards face up we will flip them both face down.

952
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:19,361
Let's see if that works. All right so, one card face up.

953
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,597
We can actually turn this card back face down, by the way.

954
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:25,734
Face up, here we go, second card. All right,

955
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:31,240
we're good. Excellent. Now what happens if two of

956
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:34,110
these cards match like that? These two cards, they match,

957
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,944
so it shouldn't do that, it shouldn't turn it down.

958
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:39,381
It needs to give us some animation that says woohoo you

959
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,217
matched two cards. Okay, so let's come up with that,

960
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,321
an animation to do that. So the animation I'm gonna do

961
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,524
when cards match is I'm gonna make the cards really big

962
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,626
to emphasize that you have a match,

963
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,227
then I'm gonna make them really small and

964
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,164
have them fade away to nothingness and disappear.

965
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,033
Because when cards match, of course I wanna take them away.

966
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,034
So that's what we're gonna do.

967
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,335
Now that's a two step animation.

968
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,603
The first step is to make them big and

969
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,206
then the second step is to animation down. And

970
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,142
we can do that with the UIView Property Animator, of course,

971
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:09,712
because of the size of the view and it's transparency

972
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,881
are animateable properties. And to make it two step like

973
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,784
that, we'll use the completion thing,

974
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,685
similar to how we did this, right.

975
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,255
We waited till the first one finished and then we went to

976
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,057
do the other one. All right, so how are we gonna do that?

977
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,561
Well, I need another private var here, actually. That's

978
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,497
just gonna tell me whether the face up cards match.

979
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,633
So I'm gonna call that faceUpCardViewsMatch,

980
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:37,773
I think I called that. Is that what I called it? Yes,

981
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:41,777
faceUpCardViewsMatch. It's a bool, we're going

982
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,912
to calculate that as well, I'm just going to return,

983
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:49,518
if our faceupcardviews.count=2,

984
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:54,423
and oops. Kind of made it on the fly. And

985
00:49:54,492 --> 00:50:00,463
face up, I'm missing an A there, faceUpCardViews

986
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:04,933
[0].rank=FaceUp,

987
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,868
and you can kind of see we don't have a model here so

988
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,339
we're kind of looking at these things directly. Again,

989
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:12,975
this is not how you would do this if you were going forward

990
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,777
to turn this into a concentration game. You would

991
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,047
have a model and all that. I'm really just doing like I said,

992
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:24,686
kind of a UI case study just to see

993
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,656
what would it look like and then later I would go back and

994
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:33,228
do my actual model or whatever. So this is

995
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:36,765
just a bool to tell us whether two face up cards match.

996
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:40,403
So down here after I've done my first card flip,

997
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:45,740
I'm gonna say if my self, of course, face up

998
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:50,679
cards views match. Then, here I'm going to do the animation.

999
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,281
Otherwise I'll going to go on and check just to see if we

1000
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,884
have two face cards that don't match. Then we'll do that flip

1001
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:57,852
down thing. But here we're not going to flip them down.

1002
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,387
We're going to make them big and then make them small.

1003
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,957
So we're going to use our view eye view property

1004
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:04,993
animator here, very simple to do. We're just gonna say

1005
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:10,866
UIViewPropertyAnimator.runnin- gPropertyAnimator.

1006
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:15,137
Again I will try to make this a little easier to see by

1007
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:20,709
getting each arguments on its own line like that. Okay.

1008
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:21,877
So here is the arguments.

1009
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:24,179
Properties, animators also very simple.

1010
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,814
The arguments, seems like there is a lot of them and

1011
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,250
they are very complicated, but they are really not. Okay.

1012
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,918
So here we are going to make the thing big.

1013
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:31,953
So how long do I want to take to make big?

1014
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:36,725
Again not really more than a second. Maybe .6 or .7. These

1015
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:40,462
are blue numbers that I would put in a constant struct and

1016
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,798
then play with to get my animation to look the way I

1017
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,400
want. And I'm not gonna delay this animation along,

1018
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,235
gonna start it right off.

1019
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:52,541
Really no un-animation options necessary here. Just going to

1020
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,577
do the animation. So in here is the closure and

1021
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:59,882
only thing I can change inside here is those view properties.

1022
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,718
Okay, if I change anything else, it will do it, but

1023
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,721
it's not gonna affect the animation in any way. So

1024
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,522
what are the animations we want to do here?

1025
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,492
Well we want all the face up cards to get really big.

1026
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,263
I'm gonna do that with the transform. Transform is really

1027
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,865
easy to make things big or rotate them or whatever so

1028
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:23,038
I'm just going to say, my face up cards views for each again,

1029
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:28,711
for each, oops. And inside this 'for each' I'm just going

1030
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:31,346
to change the properties that I want to change which is

1031
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:36,385
$0.transform=, and I'm gonna get the affine

1032
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,688
transform identity which is no rotation. And

1033
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:43,492
I'm gonna scale it by let's say three times as big. So

1034
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,196
this is gonna make this view three times its normal size.

1035
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:52,501
Let's just do just this part for now.

1036
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:56,772
We'll do this completion part in a little bit here.

1037
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,442
So I just wanna make sure that this is working. So this is

1038
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,246
gonna force us to find a match just to see if it's working,

1039
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:10,152
but I'm sure we can do that. Okay,

1040
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,122
here we go. I need a match.

1041
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,726
No, 4 and 9. No, different kinda 4, no good. There's a 9.

1042
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,995
Okay, so I'm gonna click this card. They're gonna match.

1043
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,831
And hopefully they'll get really big. And then they're

1044
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,833
gonna stop because we're not finished with this animation.

1045
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:30,439
But let's see. Whoo, okay, it worked that was easy.

1046
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:32,607
Now we want the next step of the animation we want to make

1047
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,710
it small and we're going to do its alpha so

1048
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,479
that gets small and fades away at the same time. Okay so,

1049
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,782
we're going to do that with this completion thing that

1050
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:45,320
I commented out, put that back, and expand this thing.

1051
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,690
Remember this one has the position not finished,

1052
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:51,059
but position which is either dot end, dot start, or

1053
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:54,663
dot current. And we don't really care

1054
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,532
what it is because we're not gonna have animations

1055
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,635
that are gonna be jumping on top of each other here.

1056
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,103
So it's not gonna be a problem. So

1057
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,372
here we wanna do another property animation.

1058
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,474
So I'm gonna copy and paste this whole thing right here,

1059
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:09,445
put it in here. Okay. And what are we doing with this

1060
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:11,846
property animation? Very similar to the other one.

1061
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,249
But instead of the transform being transform up to 3.0,

1062
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,721
I am going to make it really small. Down to 0.1. And

1063
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:25,394
the same time I am going to say alpha equals zero.

1064
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:29,398
Fully transparent. Now, This, remember this is going to

1065
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,166
happen immediately. It's going to set it to zero, but

1066
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:33,802
the user is going to see it, over the course of .6. And

1067
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,572
actually, this one might want to be longer, maybe .75 or

1068
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,342
something because remember I went from Identity Transform

1069
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:44,646
to 3.0 now I'm going from 3.0 passed identify down to 0.1.

1070
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,681
So maybe I wanna give it a little extra time,

1071
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,650
you see what I'm saying? To go that extra distance, so

1072
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,319
it feels like it's coming out and in at about the same time.

1073
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,989
But again, these are numbers you tweak over time

1074
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,925
as you're working on stuff. All right, so

1075
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,060
again, let's just see if this is working.

1076
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,130
I have our completion thing in there

1077
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,372
Okay, we gotta find the other match again. A three,

1078
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,043
and then an eight, an ace. No, that was ace of clubs and

1079
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,879
ace of spaded, see? There's the ace of clubs.

1080
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,782
Is that the ace of clubs? No, ace of spades. Ace of clubs.

1081
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:21,683
Okay, ready, here we go.

1082
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,052
I'm gonna click on this one, now it should go up and

1083
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,722
then go down and fade to alpha zero. Let's see.

1084
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:31,693
Perfect, okay. It worked just fine. Now,

1085
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,731
once it goes down like that, we want to remove this card,

1086
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,932
because it no longer can be involved in the matches. So

1087
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,136
we are going to implement our completion handler right here.

1088
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,170
And inside the completion handler,

1089
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,972
we're not going to be doing any view property animation,

1090
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,173
we're just going to be doing cleanup.

1091
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:49,211
For example, I'm going to say here for all these cards, so

1092
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:54,182
I'm going to have this for loop again. But not this. For

1093
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:57,252
all these cards, I want to set each of them to be isHidden,

1094
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,789
so I'm gonna hide the cards. Now, I'm also gonna clean up

1095
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,591
a little bit. Because I really don't like

1096
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,594
the idea of having these views that are really small

1097
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:09,698
transforms. Okay, and transparent, sitting around in

1098
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,866
my view hierarchy even if they're hidden. So

1099
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,537
I'm going to go ahead and make the alpha be back to 1.

1100
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:18,106
And I'm gonna go ahead and make the transform,

1101
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,875
be back to being the identity transform. So

1102
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,813
it's just a little clean up, I just don't like to have messy,

1103
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,983
weird state views lying around.

1104
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,417
They're hidden though, so it's not really gonna

1105
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,554
hurt anything to have them around there. But, for me,

1106
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:34,356
it's just a cleanliness thing, to kinda clean up

1107
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,724
after your animation a little bit.

1108
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,259
And since there it's hidden, none of this is gonna show.

1109
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,161
The fact that I'm making it transparent again and

1110
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,963
changing its transform, it doesn't matter.

1111
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:46,902
Cuz this view is now hidden from view. Okay, so

1112
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,505
that's good, we got that. What's the next thing we need

1113
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:53,875
to do, what's the next one we wanna do? We wanna make it so

1114
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:56,645
this game's a little harder. I've got this game, and

1115
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,448
it's actually a little harder than our other concentration

1116
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:03,518
game was because we have to pay more attention.

1117
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,453
Because mismatches, they flip over so

1118
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,489
fast that if I'm trying to find a match, here, phew,

1119
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,659
got lucky with a match. If I'm trying to find a match,

1120
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:15,597
it's harder to do. But I'm gonna make it even harder by

1121
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:19,067
having these cards be in motion.

1122
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,370
These cards are just gonna be constantly moving around.

1123
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,772
So I'm gonna have to chase after them to flip them over.

1124
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,743
And I'm gonna do that with our dynamic animator.

1125
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,647
Cuz that's the kind of thing a dynamic animator is good.

1126
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:35,417
Kinda set them out there and it just kinda floats around.

1127
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:38,986
All right, so, how are we gonna do that?

1128
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:43,958
Dynamic animator, let's go up here. We're gonna start, we're

1129
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,028
gonna do the 3 steps, right? Animator, behaviors, items, so

1130
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,764
let's start with the animator. I'm gonna create a lazy var,

1131
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:53,368
which we're gonna call animator. It's going to be

1132
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:57,572
a UIDynamicAnimator. And the reference view for it, I'm

1133
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,675
gonna use the referenceView constructor here.

1134
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:03,377
I'm gonna make myself.view, right, the top level view of

1135
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,714
my view controller, I'm gonna make that be my referenceView.

1136
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:08,483
Again, if you're writing an app that had like subviews and

1137
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,552
stuff, it might well be not be the top level.

1138
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,688
But this is a demo, I don't have any other views.

1139
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:15,157
So that's what I'm gonna have to do. All right, so

1140
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,226
that's gonna be my animator, great. Now I need behaviors,

1141
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:20,528
so I'm gonna create another lazy var here.

1142
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,199
I'm gonna call it my collisionBehavior.

1143
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:27,769
It's gonna be of type UICollisionBehavior.

1144
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,339
And I'm gonna initialize this one with a closure.

1145
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,774
We talked about that in lecture but

1146
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,943
we've never actually done it I don't think.

1147
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,479
So how do I initialize it with a closure? It's really easy,

1148
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,515
I just create the behavior. I create a UICollisionBehavior

1149
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:43,719
here. No arguments to its initializier, configure it.

1150
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,554
So the only thing I wanna do with this collision behavior

1151
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,091
is have the edges of my referenceView keep my cards

1152
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,559
in. The only thing the cards are gonna bounce off is each

1153
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,329
other and the edges. So, I'm gonna do this

1154
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:57,766
translateReferenceBoundsIntoB- oundary = true.

1155
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:02,704
It's a kinda cheap, quick way to get a collision boundary.

1156
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:07,308
Then I'm gonna add it to my animator, addBehavior, and

1157
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,913
then I'm gonna return behavior from the closure. This returns

1158
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,816
it from the closure, which assigns it to this var, and

1159
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:20,021
it's all lazy. We see how we use a closure there,

1160
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:25,160
really convenient. Now we have what do we have here?

1161
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:29,297
AddBehavior, add the behavior to the animator,

1162
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,166
all right? So now we have this behavior.

1163
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,103
We need to do step 3, add the items to it.

1164
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,905
Here's where we're creating all of our card views.

1165
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:43,211
Let's just say right here collisionBehavior.addItem,

1166
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,849
cardView. Now that card view is instantly going to respect

1167
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,151
that boundary and start bouncing into other cards. But

1168
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,522
of course we haven't moved the card, it's not moving, so we

1169
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,158
need to do that. We're gonna do that with a pushBehavior.

1170
00:59:57,227 --> 01:00:00,394
So I'm gonna let push = UIPushBehavior.

1171
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:03,765
Now pushBehavior's initializer here takes the items that you

1172
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:08,069
wanna push. So

1173
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:11,473
So this would only be this one cardView right here. I could

1174
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,107
create a push behavior that puts all the cards in there.

1175
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,809
But then they would all get pushed in the same direction,

1176
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:16,745
I don't want that. And then the mode,

1177
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:21,216
again, can be continuous or, in our case, instantaneous.

1178
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:24,018
We're just gonna give the card a push and then we are done.

1179
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,453
And since it's instantaneous,

1180
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:27,655
we're gonna wanna clean up after it.

1181
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,258
So let's give it an angle, so I'm gonna give it a push

1182
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:33,327
angle, which is a random angle between 0 and 2 pi. This is in

1183
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,264
radians, so I am gonna say 2 times CGFloat.pi and

1184
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,534
it's gonna be random. So I am gonna need to use arch4random.

1185
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:42,871
I added a little arch4random to CGFloat as well.

1186
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,006
We added it to int, but you already knew how to do that,

1187
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,774
but I added one for float. And

1188
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,278
then the magnitude, I don't really wanna push it 0. So

1189
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:55,583
I'm gonna do a magnitude of let's say at least 1.0, right?

1190
01:00:55,652 --> 01:01:00,255
But then I'm gonna add a certain amount extra,

1191
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:04,725
let's say 2.0 arc4random. So

1192
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,795
we're gonna have the magnitude and this has to be a CGFloat,

1193
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:11,166
right? This is a double, so we'll go CGFloat of all this.

1194
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:17,973
Oops, CGFloat(1.0), CGFloat(2.0),

1195
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:22,043
random. Probably don't need both of those CGFloats. But

1196
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:25,213
anyway, so we create a random. So I'm creating a random

1197
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:30,752
magnitude between 1 and 3. Pushing a random amount there.

1198
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:36,390
Now I just need to say to the animator. Add this behavior,

1199
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,894
add this pushBehavior. And as soon as I add it to

1200
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:41,763
the animator, it's going to push its items,

1201
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,832
which is just that one cardView. Now again, we know

1202
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,368
that this is bad because it's done now and it's never going

1203
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,204
to get cleaned up. So I'm gonna use the push.action,

1204
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:54,342
okay, to remove it from the animator by just saying push.

1205
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,645
Tell me your dynamicAnimator if you have one, and

1206
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,182
remove yourself from it. And

1207
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,185
we know that this causes a memory cycle, cuz this push

1208
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,888
right here is being kept in memory by this closure. And

1209
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,090
of course the push's action is pointing to the closure, so

1210
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,959
they're keeping each other in memory.

1211
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:15,630
So we're gonna get rid of this by just saying unowned.push.

1212
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:18,733
And yes I could've said weak push and then had an optional

1213
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:21,202
chain here, and maybe even an exclamation point here.

1214
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,437
But if I'm gonna do exclamation point,

1215
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,638
you might as well make it unowned,

1216
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:28,109
because you're unwrapping it anyway. All right, so

1217
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:29,243
let's see what happened. So

1218
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,879
all we did here is we created an animator, a collision

1219
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,949
behavior, and a push behavior. Let's see what happens,

1220
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:41,489
see if it just animates. Woo-hoo, we did it Now,

1221
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:45,059
I'm not quite getting what I want here though.

1222
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,695
One thing is look how quickly it settles down.

1223
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,932
It kind of settles down too easy, too quickly.

1224
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,034
That's gonna make it too easy to play this game.

1225
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,736
I wanted those cards moving a little more.

1226
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,672
The other thing is I don't think I want them rotated.

1227
01:02:57,741 --> 01:03:00,375
It's kind of fun to have them rotate actually.

1228
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,011
But when you flip the card, for example,

1229
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,213
it doesn't flip along the axis of the drawing.

1230
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,283
It flips along the axis of the view. So watch this flip,

1231
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,052
you see how it's kinda flipping around the corner?

1232
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,488
Maybe that's okay, but I'm gonna decide it's not.

1233
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,024
Because I also wanna show you how to do dynamic item

1234
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:19,594
behavior. Also, the reason that it's slowing down so

1235
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:23,098
much is there's not enough elasticity in the collisions.

1236
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,933
I want those collisions bouncing off and

1237
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:28,636
keeping the energy up. So let's fix, and

1238
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:33,374
we do that with another kind of behavior, kind of like our

1239
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:37,579
collision behavior. It is a itemBehavior,

1240
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,250
it's a UIDynamicItemBehaviour. And I'm gonna do that with

1241
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:47,956
a closure as well. So, we just create the behavior here,

1242
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:52,293
oops, let behavior= UIDynamicItemBehaviour.

1243
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,696
And now we'll just configure this behavior.

1244
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:58,332
So I want allowsRotation = false.

1245
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,169
I don't want those things rotating around.

1246
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:04,339
I want Elasticity and see and there's a lot,

1247
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,840
you're going to have to look in the documentation to see

1248
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,675
all of the incredible things that you can do here. But

1249
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:12,080
I want elasticity 1.0 means that collisions don't lose any

1250
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:16,384
energy or gain energy. if I set this to an elasticity 1.1,

1251
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:17,852
they would gain a little energy.

1252
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,087
Those things start going faster and faster and faster,

1253
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,558
forget it. But if I set it to 0.9, they're gonna slow down.

1254
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,894
Not as slowed down as much as they are now, but so

1255
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,797
1.0 is as kinda the most elasticity I can give it and

1256
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,567
not run into an accelerating situation. And also, I'm gonna

1257
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,537
set, I'm not sure what the default of this one is, but

1258
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,607
I'm gonna set resistance, which is how much it resists

1259
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:43,044
forces being applied on it. And I'm gonna set that to 0,

1260
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,713
I don't want any resistance. I want it to be kind of free

1261
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:49,918
flowing here in outer space not resisting anything. So

1262
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:53,688
let's add this to the animator, add behavior,

1263
01:04:56,492 --> 01:05:01,996
and return the behavior. Okay, now is that all we need to do?

1264
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:05,367
No, because if we don't add any items to this

1265
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:08,236
item behavior, then it's not going to do anything.

1266
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,738
So same way that we added the cardView to the collision

1267
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:13,073
behavior, we have to add it to the item behavior.

1268
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:17,044
And as soon as we do that, as soon as we add this thing in,

1269
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:20,648
it's gonna be having all those settings allows rotation

1270
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,317
and all that business. So let's see if that makes things

1271
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:31,759
better. Okay, it did make it better.

1272
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:35,263
Okay, it's still slowing down, which I kind of want a little

1273
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,298
bit because I want the person to have

1274
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:40,201
a chance to by they're off. They're going too fast,

1275
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,836
you're just gonna be grabbing after them and

1276
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:44,238
then you'll never remember where the other ones went. So

1277
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:45,973
I do want it to slow down a little bit.

1278
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,642
Maybe not all the way to here, I can play with this.

1279
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,145
Actually have a kind of an idea for how to keep

1280
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:54,582
things in motion as the game goes on, but still give people

1281
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:58,786
a chance by letting it slow down. But before we do that,

1282
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:01,722
I wanna talk a little bit about that creating

1283
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,994
a UIDynamicBehavior subclass, where we combine other ones.

1284
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,429
Because look, we've got three different behaviors here.

1285
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,031
We've got the collision behavior,

1286
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,767
we got the item behavior, we got the push behavior. And

1287
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,636
we're having to do all three different pieces of code for

1288
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:18,739
that in our view controller. It'd be a lot nicer if we had

1289
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,676
another behavior called the card behavior. And it had all

1290
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,246
those as part of it. And then we just add the card the card

1291
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,481
behavior, and then we'd get the collision and the item and

1292
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,718
the push automatically. So that's what we're gonna do.

1293
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:33,688
Let's go up here to File>New>File.

1294
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:35,523
I'm gonna create a Cocoa Touch Class,

1295
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,992
a UIDynamicBehavior as a Cocoa Touch Class.

1296
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:39,994
Here it is subclass of UIDynamicBehavior.

1297
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:44,365
I'm gonna call it CardBehavior. I'm gonna put it

1298
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:48,302
where all the rest of my files are there, don't forget that.

1299
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,139
Here it is, CardBehavior, a subclass of UIDynamicBehavior.

1300
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,175
And all I'm gonna do is go over here and grab all this

1301
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:59,848
stuff, and take it outta here and put it over here. Okay, so

1302
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:01,448
I'm just putting those behaviors over there,

1303
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,519
even the push. I'm gonna take the push out of here as well,

1304
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:05,420
put it over here.

1305
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,154
The push I'm gonna put in a little function,

1306
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:11,960
a private func called push, which pushes an item. This can

1307
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,296
all work on UIDynamicItem, I have UIViews but

1308
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,732
there's nothing in my code that's specific to UIView,

1309
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:21,068
it's all just dynamic items being animated here. So

1310
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,572
we'll put all that push stuff in there. Now we're gonna have

1311
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,374
to fix some of these little copy and paste problems.

1312
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:29,277
But this is essentially how you create your

1313
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:34,148
own dynamic behaviors by doing these. But these have to be

1314
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:38,953
added as children and we add them as children in an init.

1315
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:43,625
So 99.9% of the time, when you create a dynamic behavior,

1316
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,127
you're gonna override init with no argument.

1317
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,898
You're gonna call super.init, and then you're gonna add your

1318
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:53,067
children. So I've got my collision behavior,

1319
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:58,139
I'm gonna add, I've got my item behavior, I'm gonna add.

1320
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,241
Now, I can't really add my push behavior here,

1321
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,811
because the push behaviors, I need to know the item. So

1322
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,182
I can't quite do that yet. So and obviously I don't need to

1323
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,384
be adding them to animator right in here,

1324
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,187
cuz there somebody's gonna add me to an animator and

1325
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,788
that's how these things will

1326
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,291
all get put in an animator. Same thing here. So

1327
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,894
how am I gonna deal with this fact of push? Well,

1328
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:25,700
I'm also gonna add a func add item which adds an item,

1329
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,636
a UIDynamicItem. And when I add it,

1330
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,506
I'm gonna add it to all my children. So

1331
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:35,676
I'm gonna add it to collisionBehavior.addItem,

1332
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:42,283
I'm gonna add it to my itemBehavior, And

1333
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:44,952
I'm gonna push, so I'm gonna push the item too,

1334
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:48,322
which is essentially adding it to the push behavior here.

1335
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,259
So let's fix this one up, this needs to be item not cardView

1336
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:52,894
right here you see that argument, right?

1337
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,398
The push action here, notice that we're removing

1338
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,033
the behavior directly from the dynamic animator.

1339
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,904
Actually what I wanna do here instead is make it a child, so

1340
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:10,878
I'm gonna add a child behavior which is the push. And

1341
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,914
then when I remove, instead of removing behavior directly

1342
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:18,953
from the animator, I'm gonna remove my child behavior.

1343
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,692
See, now there's a little thing going on here,

1344
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:27,528
it's gonna complain once it compiles here.

1345
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:31,332
Implicitly use of 'self' in closure, use 'self'. In fact,

1346
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:36,270
I'm gonna do this if I can by just typing self., and

1347
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,505
this is now capturing self,

1348
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:42,943
which is the dynamic behavior. Yikes, okay, we don't wanna do

1349
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,512
that because the dynamic behavior definitely has

1350
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,215
a pointer to this closure, because it has a pointer to

1351
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,886
its own child behaviors of one which is the push behavior.

1352
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,221
And the push behavior points to it.

1353
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:56,190
So I'm gonna get rid of this by saying, weak

1354
01:09:56,258 --> 01:10:01,328
self. Okay, phew, broke that thing. I still need unowned

1355
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,999
push because I'm also passing push right there. Now I don't

1356
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,968
wanna do unowned self there, because just in case for some

1357
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,738
reason this whole behavior got removed from the heap,

1358
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,573
I don't wanna be crashing here.

1359
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,508
So I'm just gonna do a weak to be a little bit safe.

1360
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:17,078
It's not the same case where I know for a fact that this push

1361
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:19,046
has to be in the heap cuz I wouldn't have got here.

1362
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:24,618
That's not necessarily true of self. So we are push there so,

1363
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,621
now that we've collected all of our code right here,

1364
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,557
actually I'm gonna add one more thing,

1365
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,926
cuz we haven't seen this as convenient init.

1366
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:34,495
Okay, I'm gonna add a convenience initializer here,

1367
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:37,832
that let's me specify the animator that I wanna be in.

1368
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:39,299
I just wanna show what it looks like

1369
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,737
to create a convenience init. And all you do when you

1370
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:46,073
create a convenience init is you can all a self.init only

1371
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:49,076
on yourself, then you can do what you wanna do.

1372
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:52,112
In this case, I'm just going to tell that animator to

1373
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:56,851
add behavior myself. See how that's like a convenience for

1374
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,886
me to be able to create one of these and

1375
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:02,390
have it automatically added. So let's use that convenience

1376
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:06,827
initiator, initializer back in our view controller here,

1377
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:10,164
actually we can go back. Here it is,

1378
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:13,700
and instead of adding each item to both collision and

1379
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,437
item, we just add it to a cardBehavior,

1380
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:20,240
which we'll have to create. So I'm gonna have cardBehavior,

1381
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:23,343
add the item to cardView, and then I'm gonna create a var up

1382
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,079
here, a lazy var. It probably doesn't even need to be lazy,

1383
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:29,684
yeah, it probably does. Lazy var, which I'm gonna call

1384
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:33,754
cardBehavior, which is just gonna be a cardBehavior. And

1385
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:37,224
I'm gonna use my nice convenience initializer to say

1386
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:41,795
in my animator. Okay, so this really

1387
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:45,165
cleaned up our code here in our view controller. In fact,

1388
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,803
there's only two lines of code at all that have to do

1389
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:51,339
with our dynamic animation in this thing.

1390
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,442
We've moved it all to that nice thing. Let's make sure we

1391
01:11:54,511 --> 01:12:00,882
didn't break anything by doing that. We didn't. Okay,

1392
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:04,151
it's still working. And we can still flip out cards over.

1393
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,921
Those are separate animations going on over there. Now,

1394
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,224
I wanna do a couple of other things here.

1395
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:14,662
One is ,when you pick a card I want it to stop.

1396
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:18,298
I want it to stop being animated. You picked a card

1397
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,302
you get to take a breath, and look at your card.

1398
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:24,438
And then, if you flip the card back over or if it match it,

1399
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,375
or if doesn't match and it gets flipped over for you,

1400
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:29,944
then I'm gonna give it a push. Because see how

1401
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:33,747
everything's stopping, so now, choosing cards, we'll start

1402
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,883
pushing them a little bit and getting them going again. So,

1403
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,751
yeah, you can wait for the whole thing to slow down and

1404
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,354
stop and then you can pick a card. But once you pick them,

1405
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,056
they're gonna all move around again and

1406
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,257
be shuffled up again, make it hard on you. So

1407
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:44,925
that's seemed like a good

1408
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:48,295
compromise to me between constant movement and

1409
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,565
all sitting completely still like this. So

1410
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:53,367
how am I gonna do that? Well that's super easy to do now

1411
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,237
because I have that one behavior. And if I remove

1412
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:59,006
an item from that behavior, it's going to automatically

1413
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,242
stop animating. Because nothing will be behaving.

1414
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:04,178
There will be no behaviors operating on it. Okay, so

1415
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,112
how do I do that? Well,

1416
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,648
I'm just gonna do this right in my flip card right here.

1417
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:11,419
As soon as I get a touch that's gonna flip a card over,

1418
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:14,622
I am just gonna say cardBehavior, not that.

1419
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,624
CardBehavior with a lower case C,

1420
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:22,797
cardBehavior remove this chosenCard. Okay,

1421
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,532
but I do wanna add it back to the behaviors.

1422
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:30,003
When do I want to add it back to the behaviors? Either when,

1423
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,374
I didn't add remove item, let's make sure we do that,

1424
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:38,312
sorry. Where is our behavior? Yeah, sorry,

1425
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,582
we have add item, we need remove item as well, okay. And

1426
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,585
removeItem is exactly the same kind of thing, except for

1427
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:49,690
that we are removing things from all of the behaviors.

1428
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:53,460
Remove, Sorry about that, forgot about that. Remove,

1429
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:54,661
and, we don't have to remove the push

1430
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,064
because we automatically remove the push as soon as it

1431
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:00,868
happens, right? Here's where we're removing the push. So

1432
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:03,737
since we removed the entire push behavior we don't have to

1433
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,907
remove the items from it. So there's removeItem,

1434
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:12,012
sorry about that. Okay, clear, all right let's go back to our

1435
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,982
thing here. So now we can do a removeItem, but we wanna put

1436
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:17,118
them back in, when do we wanna put them back in?

1437
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,286
Well if you just flipped the card face down, we wanna put

1438
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:22,122
it back in then, or if the two cards gets flipped down for

1439
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,658
you automatically because you had a mismatch, then we

1440
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:27,294
also wanna do that. So, let's go put that, and we're just

1441
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:30,263
gonna put add item to put them back in those cases. So,

1442
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,968
where are those in here? Let's see if I can find them.

1443
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,672
Okay, so here is the one where two cards don't match and

1444
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,240
we're automatically flipping it face down right here, so

1445
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,410
I'm just gonna have this cardBehavior,

1446
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:48,049
add item, the card view. Okay, let's put it back in.

1447
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:51,118
It got flipped face down automatically, and

1448
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:55,088
then here's the else, oops and of course self.

1449
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,958
Does that cause a memory cycle? No because these

1450
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:01,361
are animation system closures. We're okay, all right?

1451
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,331
So here, this is in the case where there weren't two cards.

1452
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,701
There was only one card. And if you flipped the card face

1453
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:13,941
down, if the chosenCardView,

1454
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,645
it's face down, so not face up. So

1455
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:21,782
you pick the card, it's face up then you picked it again,

1456
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,551
it went face down, then here I need to have the CardBehavior

1457
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:28,188
right on itself there, because I'm not in a closure add item,

1458
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,257
put that cardView back.

1459
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,693
Now what about cases were the cards match?

1460
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,262
Don't need to put them back because they go away, right?

1461
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:36,731
We remove the areas hidden,

1462
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:39,466
so there's no reason to put them back, right? And

1463
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,704
it's not cardVew, it's chosenCardView. Okay, so

1464
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:49,510
let's see if this works. Oops cardBehavior, it's right

1465
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:52,579
in it's in the completion handler. This is in a closure,

1466
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:56,784
it's in the completion handler up here of this initial flip.

1467
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:59,386
So does this cause... every time you have to,

1468
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:01,922
any time it says this to you and you put self in there

1469
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,225
you wanna go, hmm, does this cause a memory cycle?

1470
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,494
No, it doesn't here, we're okay.

1471
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:12,866
It's just a completion handler closure, we're fine. Okay,

1472
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:15,536
so now when I click one, if I can get one, there it is.

1473
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:18,171
It stopped, see, it's not being bounced into or

1474
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,641
moving in any way. And now if I pick another one,

1475
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,344
they don't match. Now, they both get a push. Because every

1476
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,683
time I add an item back to my cardBehavior, it gets a push

1477
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:31,084
that's kind of cool, kind of a nice little feature.

1478
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,654
Same thing here, oop they don't match they got pushed.

1479
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,156
Okay, these don't match they get pushed and

1480
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,759
hopefully if we find two that match somewhere,

1481
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:41,462
somebody help me how do they know where one is.

1482
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,865
There we go, we gotta match, okay, anyhow. So

1483
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,567
this is kinda nice, it plays kinda nicer. But

1484
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:49,770
there's still some things I don't really like about this.

1485
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,173
One is, I really don't like things on the edges so

1486
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:55,476
much. I don't mind if things stop, but I'd really rather

1487
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:58,378
they be towards the middle. And so, I have a little

1488
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:03,317
fix for that, which is over here in my cardBehavior here.

1489
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,720
When I push, instead of pushing at a random angle,

1490
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,957
instead, I'm going to push, and we don't have time for

1491
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:13,594
me to type it all in. I'm gonna push towards the center.

1492
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:17,164
So depending on where the card is in its reference bounds,

1493
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:18,999
the reference views bounds,

1494
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:22,803
I'm gonna push towards the center. So this is the process

1495
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:25,906
when you do animation of kind of tuning your animation.

1496
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,875
Seeing what makes sense, what doesn't make sense.

1497
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:30,845
So this is a nice tuning thing to push towards the center.

1498
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:35,949
Another way that we can tune our animations

1499
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:39,252
here is to slow them way down. Because when they're going so

1500
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,821
quickly sometimes they're not quite working and

1501
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,858
we can't really tell. So let's go back and slow down a couple

1502
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:48,361
of our animations to see how they're doing. So, for example

1503
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:52,799
let's load down our animations of the matching cards. So when

1504
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,903
the cards match that to right here remember we're scaling it

1505
01:17:55,972 --> 01:17:59,173
up to three times and we scale it back down. And we had out

1506
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:01,608
alpha to zero. So instead of this taking, you know,

1507
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,944
about a little half a second, three quarters of a second,

1508
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,546
let's slow it way down to take six total seconds,

1509
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,614
three seconds.

1510
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:12,352
For each part of the animation and see if our app is

1511
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:16,357
working well doing that, so we're gonna find any problems.

1512
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:21,262
Okay, it's gonna require me to find a match. Let's see we got

1513
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:26,333
here search around from cards til we can find, I think,

1514
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:31,138
nope, no well, there we go. So it's going so slow, but

1515
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,173
look what happens if I click on other cards.

1516
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,140
They're still able to match,

1517
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,476
in fact I can select more than two and

1518
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,581
then they disappear. Okay why do those disappear?

1519
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:43,784
Well that's because this second animation that comes

1520
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:45,719
along sets their alpha to zero,

1521
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:49,155
picks them up along the way while this long animation is

1522
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,326
happening. So we really need to more careful when we're

1523
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,028
doing this second half especially of this animation,

1524
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,898
that we're only working on the cards that were involved in

1525
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:01,635
the match. And there's a couple of ways we can do that,

1526
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:05,138
one for example here where we're deciding whether we

1527
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,909
wanna do this animation or not we could just make sure that

1528
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:12,813
are faceUpcardViews count is always less than 2. Because if

1529
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:16,951
we already have two matching cards that are expanding and

1530
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:21,021
growing out, then we obviously can't match anymore.

1531
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,190
So that would kind of work except for

1532
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,625
that you can imagine if I had a match and

1533
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,395
the cards are expanding out that it might actually want to

1534
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:32,666
start working on my next pair. And so for that to work,

1535
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,469
we really wanna have those two matching cards not really

1536
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:39,139
count as face up cards at all. And we can do that up here.

1537
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:42,476
Here's where we decide what a face up card is. Currently

1538
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,713
it's a card that is face up and obviously is not hidden.

1539
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,449
And we could just enhance this a little bit here because we

1540
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,786
know that those cards that are expanding are either scaled up

1541
01:19:52,855 --> 01:19:57,891
to 3.0 in their transform, or their alpha is not 1, right?

1542
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,395
It's 0, in fact So we can just put those on here. So

1543
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:06,266
lets say a face up card also has to have a transformed that

1544
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:11,505
does not equal the identity transform scaled by 3.0, 3.0.

1545
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:15,742
By the way you can see the terror and

1546
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,612
danger of blue numbers because if I were to ever change

1547
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,782
this number and forget to change the same thing here,

1548
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,185
then this would not work. My animation would be out of

1549
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:28,088
sync with what I consider to be a face-up card. So this is

1550
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:31,158
where we'd wanna create a struct, a private struct and

1551
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:35,829
use statics to have those be constants. So we also want to

1552
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:39,333
make sure that our alpha here is equal to one,

1553
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,935
in other words, we're only going to consider card face up

1554
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:46,006
if it's fully visible. The last thing we're going to need

1555
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:50,210
to do here also though is when we go into our animations,

1556
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:53,647
notice that we look for which cards are face up.

1557
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:57,551
By calling this self.face up card views, all right?

1558
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:01,221
And that is this thing right here. Well this is dynamically

1559
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,091
always calculating the cards that are face up, so

1560
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,560
if we have an animation here and it starts off and

1561
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,696
is going and then it tries to do its second part, it looks

1562
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,866
for the face drop cards again. When in fact, we just want

1563
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:16,870
this entire animation to apply to the original two cards that

1564
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:20,874
were chosen. So we can capture that by just having

1565
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:24,277
a little local variable. Here I am going to call it cards

1566
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:29,049
to animate that equal the face of cards at the time

1567
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,552
we start the animation. Okay so we are sort of capturing

1568
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,254
them here. And then going through and using this.

1569
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:38,324
So everywhere we're re-looking up these face up cards instead

1570
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,127
we want to use the cards to animate. So

1571
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:44,131
let's go down here, this one, this one, this one, I'm just

1572
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,168
searching and replacing here all of those cards to animate.

1573
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:52,773
So let's try all of that and see if that has made it so

1574
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:57,577
that our nice, winning animation doesn't have that

1575
01:21:57,646 --> 01:22:01,681
same problem. So, I've gotta find our matches again,

1576
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,851
whoops, let's see. There we go, there's a match.

1577
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,653
Now I'm gonna click on other cards and it's able to match

1578
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:11,158
them. And that long animation was still continuing. So

1579
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:14,027
that's much better UI. Now of course we're not gonna have

1580
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:17,698
our matching animation take so long, but by making it take so

1581
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,334
long we are able to find that problem. So let's put that

1582
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:25,472
back to what it was. I think we had like .6 and

1583
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,475
.75. Let's take another animation and slow it down,

1584
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,877
how about the animation where the cards don't match and

1585
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,679
we flip them back over? Okay,

1586
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:34,948
that's this animation of it flipping over and

1587
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:37,651
then here is where it flips the two mismatching

1588
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,520
cards over. So lets slow both of those down.

1589
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:43,023
So that one down and slow this one down here.

1590
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,394
This was the matching animation.

1591
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:52,599
I want the, the original flip animation there. All right, so

1592
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,868
we click, okay our original flip animation.

1593
01:22:54,937 --> 01:22:57,370
Okay, it's going real slow, nothing seems to be a problem.

1594
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,574
Let's try another one that goes slow. And

1595
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,676
they both, okay. It all looks okay.

1596
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:05,411
Let's try clicking a little faster. How about this one and

1597
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,581
this one? All right, they both go slow.

1598
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,852
Wow, what's happening? Okay, what happened to that ten,

1599
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,221
that second card? It kind of, it didn't flip over.

1600
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,990
It kind of jumped, and then it flew around.

1601
01:23:17,059 --> 01:23:18,726
Let's try it again to see what's happening here.

1602
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:20,928
Let's try this one and this one, here we go,

1603
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,796
whoa. Okay, so something is clearly wrong here. So

1604
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:28,301
what is happening here that's making that card go so wacky?

1605
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:31,972
Well, what's happening here is both the original card, that

1606
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:36,309
we flipped up, and the second card are both trying to flip

1607
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:40,614
the two cards face down. Okay, and so those two transforms,

1608
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,083
those two modifications here via transition,

1609
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:47,320
they're both trying to operate on the cards at the same time.

1610
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,823
And when you have something in the middle of transforming and

1611
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:51,258
another transform comes along,

1612
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:54,561
it's basically messing up the whole transform. Now,

1613
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,397
an easy fix for this one too which is let's just always

1614
01:23:57,466 --> 01:23:59,933
let the latest card that was chosen

1615
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:03,003
control the animation. That way they'll never interfere

1616
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:05,205
with each other because when the second one comes along and

1617
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:08,341
chooses it gets to do the animation. So let's do that by

1618
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,811
just creating a little var here, to keep track of our

1619
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,882
last chosen card view which will be a playing card view of

1620
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:19,686
course. And it'll start out nil, that's fine cuz we

1621
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:24,658
don't have a last chosen card view when we start out. And

1622
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,294
so every time that we go through and choose a card,

1623
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,529
okay right here, this is where we choose card.

1624
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:32,932
We're just gonna remember that our lastChosenCardView =

1625
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:37,203
chosenCardView. And then when we get down here to this

1626
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:40,841
animation of them closing down here, we're only gonna do this

1627
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:45,612
if the chosenCardView equals the last chosen card

1628
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:54,554
view. So,

1629
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,990
that way, this animation right here can only happen,

1630
01:24:57,059 --> 01:24:58,826
can only be controlled, by the last card.

1631
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:01,161
And they won't interfere with each other. So

1632
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,998
we need a self right here and let's try this.

1633
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:13,940
All right so here's this one, it started animating,

1634
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:16,643
start this one and it worked.

1635
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,911
Okay it let the first one finish its animation and

1636
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,814
then it didn't do it, didn't do the flip and waited for

1637
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:26,353
the second one to do it. Okay, so these

1638
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:29,556
are the kind of things when you're tuning your animation,

1639
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,059
that slowing them down will help you find these

1640
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,094
overlapped things. And you might think well,

1641
01:25:34,163 --> 01:25:34,961
these cards are flipping so

1642
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:37,430
fast, users would never be able to do this, but

1643
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:40,701
they absolutely can. Users tend to click, click, click,

1644
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:43,403
click, click. Oops, they're clicking quickly to try and

1645
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:46,473
make things happen, so you wanna be prepared for that. So

1646
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,242
I'm gonna put these back to where they were.

1647
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:54,080
What do I have, I don't know, 0.5 or

1648
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:59,653
something, 0.6, something like that.

1649
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:06,025
Okay so, here we got this guy and that guy.

1650
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:08,495
Let's see if we can find a match here somewhere.

1651
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:14,334
This one. No, it's hard to find a match at this game.

1652
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:15,368
It's quite a difficult game.

1653
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:20,440
I found that I'm not really very good at it. There's

1654
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:23,210
that jack, I think that one there. Yeah, there's a match.

1655
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:27,681
No that moved. King over here? There we,

1656
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:31,351
that was king of clubs, or king of spades. All right,

1657
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:35,955
well anyway, there we go, there's a match. Alright,

1658
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:39,092
I believe that's all I have time to show you. I think I've

1659
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:41,762
got through most of the stuff I want to show you, so your

1660
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,998
homework is just to animate your set. In very predefined

1661
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:50,404
ways. So you'll be using these exact same three mechanisms.

1662
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:52,271
Transitions, view properties, and

1663
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,075
the dynamic animator. All right?

1664
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,543
I'll see you all next week. >> For
