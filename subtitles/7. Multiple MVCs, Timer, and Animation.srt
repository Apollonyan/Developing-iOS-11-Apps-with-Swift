00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:14,012
welcome to Lecture number 7, Stanford CS193P, Fall 2017. So
欢迎来到 2017 年秋季学期 CS193P 的第七节课

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,351
our primary topic today is combining MVCs to make bigger,
今天，我们的主要任务显然就是将多个 MVC 组合成组件更多，

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,153
more powerful applications, obviously. And
功能更强大的应用程序。

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,890
then I'm gonna do a big demo that shows you how to do that.
同时，我也将示范编写一个更大的样例程序来向你们展示该如何完成这项工作。

7
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,559
We're gonna do it with Concentration, we're gonna add
本次的示范将以 Concentration 这个 app 为基础，我们将来要向其添加

8
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,929
an MVC into that app. Then I'll come back to the slides,
一个 MVC。然后我会回到幻灯片上，

9
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,865
and talk I'll about timer and choose classes, some of you
（这里疑似all about）我会讲授有关计时器和选择类的相关内容，

10
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,169
used in the extra credit of the homework assignments. And
这部分内容你们可能会在作业的选做部分需要用到。

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,004
then I'm gonna dive into the next topic and try and
然后的时间我会尽可能深入讲解下一个主题，也就是动画部分，

12
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,373
get as far as I can which is animation.
能讲多少讲多少。

13
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,275
Which will be our topic on Wednesday and
这也将是我们在周三的课程上的主要内容，

14
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,376
I'll get to much more detail, do a big demo.
并且我会更深入地讲解更多细节性内容，做一个更大的示范程序。

15
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,512
But I wanna kinda get in as far as I can today just so
我今天会尽可能地讲解理论部分的内容，

16
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,916
we have more time for a demo on Wednesday.
这样我们周三上课时就会有足够的时间进行操作示范。

17
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,486
Alright so combining MVCs, remember this slide from when
回到整合 MVC 上来，还记得我们讲解 MVC 时使用的这张幻灯片吗？

18
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,190
I talked about MVC. This is the MVCs working together, and
这就是多个 MVCs 协同工作的示意图，

19
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,193
we saw that when we have MVCs working together,
我们可以看到，当多个 MVCs 协同工作时，

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,862
these other MVCs. Let me get my thing under control here,
其他的 MVC……（此处幻灯片动画出错）让我把它修好……

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,967
well, can't do it. Okay, these other MVCs down in the corner,
好吧，它彻底坏掉了。其他的角落里的 MVCs

22
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:12,170
they serve as part of the view of another MVC. That's
他们通过控制其他 MVC 中的一个 view，来为整个 app 服务。

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,608
the way MVC's relate. An MVC is a view, part of a view
这就是 MVC 之间相互联系的方法。一个 MVC 就是一个 view，同时也是其他类中的 view 的一部分。

24
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,811
of another class. And that has some ramifications for MVC,


25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,781
most notably it has to have blind structured communication

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,618
back to the other MVC. But that's the way we

27
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,154
structure it, and that keeps everything well contained and

28
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,523
understandable. So we're gonna talk about how we do that,

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,595
how we make MVCs that are the view of other MVCs. So,

30
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,065
combining MVCs we do this using some special

31
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:44,569
controllers that iOS provides whose view is other MVCs.

32
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:48,339
Now you could write your own special MVC whose view is

33
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,544
other MVCs. But 99% of the time you're gonna use one of

34
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,980
the three that iOS provides. And the three that iOS

35
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,418
provides are TabBarController, SplitViewController, and

36
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,520
navigation controller. Now there are other ways to

37
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,157
combine MVCs we'll talk about later in the quarter but

38
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,859
this is the primary way that we're gonna do it with these

39
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,229
three MVC's. Those three here, TabBar, SplitView, and

40
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,567
NavigationController, they are the controllers of MVCs. So

41
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,002
let's look at them one by one.

42
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,870
TabBar is by far the simplest one,

43
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,240
you've seen this a million times, it's got

44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,475
some tabs along the bottom there. You see those tabs,

45
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,179
like a little orange thing and the gray one's next to it. And

46
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:31,049
each of those tabs, when you press it, shows another MVC.

47
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,519
So you can already see that the TabBarController's view

48
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:39,257
includes the buttons at the bottom and another MVC. So

49
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,227
this is what we mean by the view of this tab bar

50
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,498
controller MVC gives another MVC. And the icon and

51
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,566
the title that appears down in the TabBar,

52
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,570
that's determined by which MVC is showing.

53
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,240
In specific UI view controller has this bar TabBar item.

54
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,709
And the TabBar controller, when it shows the MVC as part

55
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,280
of its view, it looks at that so it knows what the title and

56
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,917
icon to display down at the bottom there. This is all very

57
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:10,722
object oriented in that sense. So, for example here we've got

58
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,658
some sort of health oriented API here and

59
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,961
we've got the four tabs at the bottom. By the way, if there's

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,300
more than four tabs, more than four MVCs, it can show that,

61
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,469
actually, it'll show five. And if they're six, then

62
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,439
the fifth one becomes a little more button and you click it.

63
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:31,243
And iOS provides an API or UI, rather, for the user to pick

64
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,044
which tabs they want to be there at the bottom, or

65
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,480
to pick some other tab that's not showing. Generally though,

66
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,384
we recommend no more than five MVCs in a TabBarController.

67
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,720
That's kinda just pretty good UI,

68
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,154
It just starts to get a little complicated for

69
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,291
the user if there's more than that. So, in this case,

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,395
this whole thing is five MVCs, the TabBarController itself,

71
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,131
and the four MVCs that serve as its view and

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,934
you just switch between them by clicking.

73
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,805
So this is by far the easiest Of the MVCs of MVCs,

74
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,008
all right? Next, let's talk about SplitViewController,

75
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,911
probably the second simplest one. It's only two MVCs in its

76
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,348
view, and it puts them side by side with a very thin line in

77
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,751
between them. So, here's a little calculator app,

78
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,454
It's got the calculator on the left and then it's got maybe

79
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,790
a graph of what's in the calculator on the right. And

80
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,628
we call this MVC that's on the left, and it's usually smaller

81
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,132
like this, the Master in the SplitViewController, and

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,134
we call the one on the right the Detail. And

83
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,471
we call them master detail cuz usually what you do on the one

84
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,672
on the left affects what happens on the right. It's

85
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,942
the master, the detail is kind of little bit of a slave. And,

86
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,614
of course, this is on iPad. It also works on iPhone Pluses,

87
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:47,084
but non-plus iPhones. This little side-by-side mechanism.

88
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,486
You can, of course, rotate your iPad.

89
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,089
And when you rotate your iPad into portrait, now

90
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:55,026
it'll only show the detail, except for you can slide out

91
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,528
with your finger from the left and see the Master,

92
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,899
then slide it back. Now on an iPhone Plus in portrait,

93
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,403
it acts like a normal iPhone, it doesn't have the slide out.

94
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,904
Even if an iPhone Plus is not quite wide enough to

95
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,810
slide that thing out. So, SplitViewController, super,

96
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,646
super easy. And then there's NavigationController.

97
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,282
This is probably the most flexible, most powerful of

98
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,652
the MVC of MVCs, you've seen this a million times in IOS

99
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,855
apps. You can think of a NavigationController MVC,

100
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:28,025
as a deck of cards. And each card is an MVC. And what

101
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,829
the navigation controller does is let you put an MVC on top,

102
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,499
obscuring all the ones below. And then if you hit the back

103
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,201
button, it throws that one away, and shows you the one

104
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,337
that was there before. And you can keep going back, and

105
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,871
it keeps showing the cards off the top, and

106
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,009
you put new cards back on. So it's like a card stack, where

107
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:48,512
the stack are MVCs. And you can see that the navigation

108
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,583
controller as part of its view it does actually draw a little

109
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,319
bit. At the top it draws a little title there, right?

110
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,155
The settings, okay, that's not part of the MVC that's

111
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,458
showing right there. But the content that are in that title

112
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,562
are driven by whatever MVCs on top of the card stack,

113
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,965
the one that's showing. So that's called settings

114
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,734
because the MVC that's there is the settings MVC, so

115
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,605
it's being driven by what's there. And each MVC,

116
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,708
similar with the tab bar item and the tab bar controller,

117
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:21,012
there's a var in UI Controller called navigationItem. And

118
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,649
that contains things like the title and other buttons that

119
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,252
you can put in the title bar, all kinds of stuff.

120
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,953
You're gonna wanna go look at the documentation for

121
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,754
navigationItem and

122
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,657
see what kind of things the navigation controller can

123
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:37,596
do for you when your MVC is on top of the stack. So

124
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,732
if I then click on something, this is a table view here,

125
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,001
we'll talk about table views next week or the week after.

126
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,639
If I click on something here then a new MVC slides in,

127
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:52,477
animates in on top. Now there are two cards on this stack.

128
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,179
All settings one which is now behind,

129
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,715
we can't see it, and now this new one on top of course.

130
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,618
By the way you can also have tool bar

131
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,353
items on the bottom using the tool bar items bar of view

132
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,288
controller, so those two of our items would come and

133
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,626
go as new ones come on the stack. But

134
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,961
also notice that when we have two things on there,

135
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,863
a little back button appears in the upper left,

136
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,600
automatically. It even has the name of the one that's

137
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,903
lower down on the stack of cards. And if you press that,

138
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,805
of course it's gonna throw this card away, and

139
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,842
we'll be back at the other card. But lets imagine I click

140
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,409
on something in this one like this

141
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,679
accessibility thing. It puts a new card on there,

142
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,781
that's the accessibility card. Maybe I click on something

143
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,718
inside the accessibility card like larger text, and it puts

144
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,388
another one on. Now we have four MVCs on the the stack.

145
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,156
So there's a total of five MVCs here.

146
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,926
The navigation controller itself which is an MVC, and

147
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:46,197
these four MVCs which are part of its view. And of course we

148
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,333
know we can backup if we pres the back button and

149
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,902
it throws that button away, and it actually does throws

150
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,237
the card away. Throws it out of the heap.

151
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,773
So it's complete throw away, this card now gets thrown

152
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,242
away, we are just now seeing the card on the underneath

153
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,212
until we go all the way the back, To the beginning and

154
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,180
now we're seeing the root card, the root

155
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,150
view controller, this is called a navigationController.

156
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,385
All right, so everybody knows about navigationController,

157
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,787
you've seen it everywhere.

158
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,089
Here's how navigational controller's working behind

159
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,527
the scenes in terms of looking at it from an MVC standpoint.

160
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,462
So let's say I have a MVC that's shown there,

161
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,198
and I have more API or more UI than I can fit on

162
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,369
my screen, so I need to got to another screen to do more UI.

163
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,905
That's the little thing in the corner right there. Well, to

164
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,142
do that I have to make another MVC that will control that UI.

165
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,078
And then when I make my navigationController

166
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,015
to have them share the screen, the navigationController comes

167
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,684
up and this is what its UI looks like. But as soon

168
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,587
as you set a very important var in navigationController,

169
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,690
call it rootViewController to be some MVC,

170
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,162
then its view now includes the view of that MVC. And

171
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,298
then, if you interact with some button or

172
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,534
something that's in that MVC's view,

173
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,472
it can move to this other MVC, push it on the stack.

174
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,173
Now the other MVC is still there, it's just kind of

175
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,644
behind the scenes because it's lower on the stack, and a back

176
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,378
button will automatically appear as we saw.

177
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,882
When we click this back we move back to the other one,

178
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,285
and notice that the MVC that we had originally added

179
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,522
on there is gone. So it's very important to understand

180
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,056
as we use the navigationController,

181
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,392
usually when we put things on we're creating a new one and

182
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,461
when we take things off we're throwing it away.

183
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,164
That is the normal operation of a navigationController. It

184
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,669
can be used in other ways but that is it's normal operation.

185
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,341
Okay, so those are the three kinds of MVCs of MVCs.

186
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,444
How do you get at them? Okay, it's really easy actually.

187
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,015
Each of those three different kinds of MVCs has a var called

188
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,951
viewControllers, it's just an array of view controller. So

189
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,854
for a tab bar it's just the view controllers one, two,

190
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,089
three, four in order I think from left to right,

191
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,426
the tabs. If it's a split-view controller,

192
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,128
then view controller sub 0 is the master and

193
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,697
view controller sub 1 is the detail.

194
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,632
Or sometimes we say the first thing in the array is

195
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,469
the master and the last thing in the array is the detail.

196
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,170
And if it's a navigationController, then

197
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,806
viewController sub 0 is the rootViewController, and all of

198
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,744
these cards lined on top are the other viewControllers

199
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,079
in the array in order. So that's how you can get at all

200
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,449
the viewControllers that are in one of the MVCs of MVCs.

201
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:22,020
Now, how do you get at the MVC of MVCs itself?

202
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,354
How do you get to the navigationController,

203
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,756
the splitViewController, whatever?

204
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,058
Well there's three awesome vars in UI view controller

205
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,460
called tabBarController, splitViewController, and

206
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,962
navigationController. And they will tell you the tabBar

207
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,632
controller you're in, or the splitViewController you're

208
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,401
in or the navigationController you're in. It might be in more

209
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,037
than one, because you might be inside a navigationController

210
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,373
as the master in a splitViewController.

211
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,642
Which might even be in a tab of a tab bar controller, so

212
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,045
you could be in all three of these things, and this will

213
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,214
return what you're in. And so this way you can kinda get

214
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:55,153
at the other MVCs that are involved in whatever

215
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,723
combination of MVCs you have. So it's really good

216
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:04,895
kind of access to things. Now navigationController,

217
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,064
I wanna just briefly tell you about the API for

218
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,200
it, it has a method pushViewController and

219
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,636
popViewController, both can be animated. And

220
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,973
that takes an MVC and puts it on the stack of your cars or

221
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,908
popViewController pops the top one off. Okay,

222
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,444
so you can do that pushing and popping, but we don't usually

223
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,447
do it that way. We usually use what are called segues which

224
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,884
I'm going to talk about in a moment here.

225
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,751
All right, so

226
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,488
how do we wire all of this stuff in our storyboard up?

227
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,723
Okay, how do we get these navigationControllers, and

228
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,791
splitViewControllers and

229
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,594
tabBarControllers all hooked up to our MVCs? Okay, well

230
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,964
of course we do it with Ctrl drag in the interface field,

231
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,333
we do everything with Ctrl drag, right? Constraints,

232
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,336
outlets, actions, all of these stuff with Ctrl drag, and

233
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,605
we use Ctrl drag to do this as well. So

234
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,208
let's look at an example of a splitViewController.

235
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,076
If I wanted to have a couple of MVCs and

236
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,344
set them as the master and

237
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,279
the detail in splitViewController,

238
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,748
I would just drag out a splitViewController from

239
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,249
the same place I get a button or

240
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,954
something. It will come with a bunch of extra VCs by the way,

241
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,990
view controller is kind of, that it comes with for fun or

242
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,827
for free. I'm not sure why it does it. We usually almost

243
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,463
always just delete them. And then we Ctrl drag from

244
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,666
the splitViewController to our master and we control drag

245
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,702
to our detail. Same thing with a tabBarController, we drag it

246
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,840
out and then we just Ctrl drag to each of the MVCs in there.

247
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,807
NavigationController is a little bit different and

248
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,043
I'll show you that in a moment.

249
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,212
So this is what it looks like approximately in interface

250
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,714
builder ,here's the calculator again. I dragged out

251
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,716
a splitViewController there on the left, I just Ctrl drag

252
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,486
to the master. I choose Master View Controller from the thing

253
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,288
that pops up. I Ctrl dragged it to the other one,

254
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,326
I choose detail, bam, I've got a wired up splitViewController

255
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:47,865
right there. Couldn't be simpler. Now the split view

256
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,368
can really only do it's thing fully on an iPad.

257
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,272
Cuz there's just not enough screen real

258
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,308
estate on other devices to really do this side by

259
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,843
side thing, especially the portrait mode slide out thing,

260
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:04,582
there's just not enough room there. So what we often do

261
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,752
is wrap the master in a navigationController.

262
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,822
And when we do that then the system can show it

263
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,557
in a navigationController on an iPhone, and

264
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,459
in a splitViewController on an iPad.

265
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,262
It'll automatically adapt, that's the word we use to

266
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,431
describe that to the environment it's in.

267
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,735
So that makes it really easy for us to build UIs that work

268
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,770
on both. They work on iPads, they work on iPhones.

269
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,440
Okay, same exact storyboard. So here's what that looks

270
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,842
like, here's my split view with my master and

271
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,411
my detail there, we're looking at the master. And

272
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,547
I 'm selecting it and I'm going to the menu and

273
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,016
I'm saying editor embed in navigationController.

274
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,586
So instead of dragging the navigationController out,

275
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,920
which I could do by the way and

276
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,556
just Ctrl drag them up, but instead of dragging it out you

277
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,126
can actually do this embed in navigationController.

278
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,796
And it will insert a navigationController MVC

279
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:55,132
in as the master and make my previous thing that was

280
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,134
the master be it's rootViewController.

281
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,070
So, now I have a navigationController

282
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,975
wrapping around the master of my split view. Okay, this also

283
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,077
has a nice benefit, it puts a title on your master,

284
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,114
which is often nice to have a title of your master of

285
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,517
your split view. Now you can- One thing to notice about this


286
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,420
of course, is that now the master of your split view is
现在你的 Split View 的主视图控制器不再是 Calculator 了，

287
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,757
no longer the calculator, it's a navigationController.
而是一个 navigationController。

288
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,492
So if you actually wanted to get out the calculator,
如果你确实想要获取到 calculator，

289
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,394
you would have to get the master and
你必须先获取到主视图控制器，

290
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:27,465
then look at the master's rootViewController to find
然后找到它的 rootViewController，

291
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,901
the calculator there.
你要找的 calculator 在那里。

292
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,469
By the way, you can also put the detail, wrap it in
另外，你也可以把你的细节视图控制器放在一个 navigationController 中

293
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,839
a navigationController. The only reason you would ever
你想做这件事，唯一的原因就是

294
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,908
want to do that is to give it a title bar, cuz you don't,
想给它一个标题栏。

295
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,445
you always navigate from the master, that's why it's called
你总是从主视图控制器导入的，这也是他被称为“主”的原因。

296
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,313
the master. So you can do it, but again if you do that,
所以你可以这么做，不过再一次，如果你这么做的话

297
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,716
make sure when you look at the detail, if you find that
确保当你关注 detail 的时候，

298
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,652
it's a navigationController, you need to look inside and
如果你发现他是一个 navigationController，你就需要向里看，

299
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,488
see the thing that's inside of it, the rootViewController.
找到它内部的视图控制器，rootViewController。

300
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,223
Or you can also use visibleViewController
或者你也可以用 visibleViewController

301
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,392
on a navigationController,

302
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,260
that will tell you the card that's on the top,

303
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,331
that's visible. All right, so that's how we wire up split

304
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,034
views navigationControllers together. How do we make it so

305
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,905
that when we click something in a view it causes

306
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,043
some card to slide on, or it causes the detail of our split

307
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,379
view to change, right? We're doing the calculator,

308
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,281
we enter some equation, we press the graph button.

309
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,118
Well in the iPhone we wanna slide a graph in front,

310
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,254
on the stack. And on the iPad we want to replace the detail

311
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,757
view with a graph of what's in my current calculator.

312
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,293
So how do we do that? We do that with what's called

313
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:34,265
segues. A segue just makes a brand new MVC,

314
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,067
always a new MVC, I'm gonna say that three or

315
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,704
four times, so that sinks in. Always a new MVC,

316
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,306
it makes it and puts it on the top of the stack or

317
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,910
puts it in the right side of a splitViewController.

318
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,912
So here are the kinds of segues that exist.

319
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,581
There is a Show Segue, that's the kind of segue that works

320
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,982
in a navigationController.

321
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,418
Okay, that causes the new MVC to be

322
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,254
put on top of a stack if you're not Inside a Navigation

323
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,024
Controller you probably shouldn't be doing Show Segue.

324
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,828
Then there's Show Detail, that works in a split view. So

325
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,866
Show Detail will replace the right side of the split view.

326
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,201
Then there's Modal and Popover,

327
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,869
which I'm going to talk about later in the quarter.

328
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,773
Modal takes over the entire screen. So forget about any

329
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,575
navigation controllers or split view controllers, or

330
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,777
tab view controllers. It takes over the entire screen and

331
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,112
just fills the screen with the MVC.

332
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,748
We generally try to avoid Modal because it puts

333
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,518
the app in this kind of stuck state where it's only the MVC

334
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,488
that you've taken over the screen with is active,

335
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,190
can be kind of disconcerting for the user but

336
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,525
sometimes we do want things to be Modal. And

337
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,328
then Popover Segue is kind of like a Modal segue but

338
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,562
instead of taking over the whole screen,

339
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,264
it just puts it up in a little popover.

340
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,366
You've seen that on an iPad especially. But

341
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,636
it's still modal because the background is grayed out and

342
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,671
you can't interact with it,

343
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,473
you can only do the thing in the popover. So

344
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,074
we'll talk about those segues later in the quarter.

345
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,644
Today I'm just gonna talk about show and show detail. So

346
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,014
this is in red.

347
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,285
I'm just re-emphasizing that segues always create a new

348
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,590
instance of the MVC. Segues always create a new instance

349
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,091
of the MVC. This is important to understand. You're not

350
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,395
gonna be reusing some MVC that you had on screen before. And

351
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,231
we'll show in our demo today, what we can do about this if

352
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,869
we really do want re-use of MVCs. By the way, the back

353
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,505
button in a navigation controller is not a segue.

354
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,807
That's just part of the navigation controller,

355
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,442
so when you go back you're not creating a new MVC. You're

356
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,945
going back to the one that was on the stack underneath.

357
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,081
All right, so how do we make these segues happen?

358
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,684
Ctrl-drag. We do Ctrl-drag for everything.

359
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,286
It can also be done in code as well, and

360
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,921
I'll show you how to do that in the demo, too.

361
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,457
So, if I have this calculator example. Here's my split view

362
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,760
with the navigation controller around the master, and

363
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,994
I've got a button in my calculator

364
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,963
which is show me a graph of what's currently in

365
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,733
the calculator. I just Ctrl-drag from that button.

366
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,902
Down to the lower left here to my detail. And

367
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,738
when I let go of the control drag a little black window is

368
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,141
going to come up and there is it more detail and

369
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,179
it will choose the show detail segway there. Okay, and

370
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,082
that will create this little line. See the line that it

371
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,352
created right there, which we can click on and inspect. And

372
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,754
that little line is called a segue, so that's

373
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,190
a thing in your storyboard that you can inspect.

374
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,292
And why do you wanna inspect that little line?

375
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,829
Mostly because you wanna give a unique identifier which is

376
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,764
just a string. So I'm gonna call this one for

377
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,834
example show graph cuz that's what this segue does. And

378
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,371
then in my code, I can refer to that segue by the name,

379
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,740
show graph. Everything in interface builder files,

380
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,776
all these storyboards, is always referenced by name. And

381
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,413
the great thing about that is that you can copy and paste

382
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,048
things to one storyboard to another as long as the names

383
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,684
in your code are their right names, it'll just work.

384
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,885
So that's why it goes by name.

385
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,688
Okay, it does everything by name. Some people think it

386
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,624
kind of can be a little annoying that you have to have

387
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,026
these names that are exactly the same in the code and

388
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,861
in the storyboard. But it turns out to be quite

389
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,764
a flexible thing to do it that way. A little more work for

390
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,733
the programmer to ensure that those things are the same but

391
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,135
kinda worth it in flexibility, I think.

392
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:02,472
All right, so that's the main thing you wanna inspect.

393
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,710
You can also inspect whether it's show detail or

394
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,479
show, but you're gonna see that, in my demo, you actually

395
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,115
don't wanna change that show detail to show right there.

396
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:15,319
Your better off creating a new segue. Okay, so

397
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:18,522
that's segues. So that identifier. Why do we want it?

398
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,459
Where would we use it in our code? What's an example? Well,

399
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,395
one way is you can perform a segue from code.

400
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,032
So manually cause a segue to happen. Okay well to do that

401
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,968
you need to know which segue it is in the storyboard you

402
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,938
want to perform manually and so you can do perform segway.

403
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,640
We don't usually perform manually. I'll show it in

404
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,910
the demo we don't usually do it that often. Okay because

405
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,246
the real way we do it is just the control dragging and

406
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,348
that's gonna automatically segue from that button so

407
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,284
we don't need to do it from the code. But

408
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,420
the most important use of identifier is to prepare

409
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:53,357
the MVC that you're segue to. Okay think about

410
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,860
the calculator example. I press graph and it's going to

411
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,530
show me a graph, presumably it's going to show me a graph

412
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,832
of what's in my calculator. Well I have

413
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,402
to somehow let that new graphing MVC know what

414
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:10,174
equation to graph. We call that preparing that

415
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:14,111
MVC to do it's job and segues always create a new MVC so

416
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,947
they always have to be prepared to do what they do.

417
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,784
Makes sense? So we do that with a function called prepare

418
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,021
for segues. This function is implemented in the MVC,

419
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,624
that is causing the segues to happen. It's obviously

420
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,395
the only one who could prepare the new MVC To be ready to go.

421
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,596
This is what that method looks like.

422
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,532
Prepare for segue. It has two arguments: the segue,

423
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,336
which is a UI storyboard segue.

424
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,072
That segue mostly just has the identifier and

425
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,541
also the MVC that we need to prepare.

426
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,811
The MVC that it just created, that we're going to segue to

427
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,748
the second argument there, the sender that's the button or

428
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,017
the line in a table view. Or if you're doing it from code

429
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,853
it can be almost anything, that's why it's of type any.

430
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,322
That cause this segue to happen,

431
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,726
that could also be nil. It's happening, you don't know or

432
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:07,665
care, who did it. So that's what those two arguments are.

433
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,534
All right, now let's dive into this thing.

434
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,936
The first thing we usually do is take a look

435
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,340
at our identifier, our segue identifier which could be nil.

436
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,509
Shouldn't be, you always wanna set an identifier in your

437
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,243
story board. But we look at it and

438
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,545
here I'm gonna switch on it, although,

439
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,515
we can use if then on it, and find out which segue it is.

440
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,052
And that's because an MVC can have multiple different

441
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,521
buttons, each that segue to a different kind of MVC. So

442
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,224
we obviously, have to prepare them differently.

443
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,260
So, we need to know which one is which.

444
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,261
So, that's why we check the identifier to see

445
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,432
which segue we're talking about. Then, we need to get

446
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,802
the MVC that we are segueing to and prepare it.

447
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,872
Okay, well, segue.destination, that var segue.

448
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,909
That var destination in the segue object is passed to you.

449
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,511
That is the view controller that you're segueing to,

450
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,182
the brand new just created MVC, all right. But

451
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,120
the type of that argument is not gonna be a graph

452
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,156
controller or something like that, it's going to be just

453
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,192
UI View controller. That's because Segue,

454
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,329
UI Storyboard Segue Class, each var has to have a type,

455
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,697
and it can't know anything about a graph.

456
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,366
It was written by Apple years ago. It's

457
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:21,137
a type UI View controller. So that means we have to use as,

458
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,441
right, the typecasting to downcast it,

459
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,112
to the kind of MVC controller we think this is,

460
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,381
based on which segue it is. So in this case,

461
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,118
it's the calculator case, I think it's a graph controller,

462
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,520
that controls one of these graphing things. So

463
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,689
I'm going to downcast. If that fails,

464
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,390
then obviously I can't prepare it.

465
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,895
That's why I do if let there. Okay, but if it doesn't fail

466
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,531
then now I can set properties in the graph controller,

467
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,567
call methods, whatever is necessary to get it to know

468
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:54,004
what function to graph so that it can do its job. Okay, we

469
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,641
prepare it. Cool, everybody? Everybody make sense?

470
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,509
It's very important to understand prepare for segues.

471
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,912
You can't do any multiple MVC stuff without understanding

472
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,715
this method. It's the most important method in all of

473
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:10,521
multiple MVCs, all right? Now, red again.

474
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,390
Look, some red on the slide. It is absolutely crucial to

475
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,194
understand that when you're executing these yellow lines,

476
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,563
you're preparing that MVC when that's happening.

477
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:24,635
That MVC's outlets have not been set yet. So

478
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:25,803
all those outlets,

479
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,238
like in our Concentration the card buttons,

480
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:32,209
the flip count, all those labels they're all nil. Now,

481
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,045
they're implicitly unwrapped optionals, but they're still

482
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,814
gonna get unwrapped when you try to access them.

483
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,550
This will cause many crashes in your apps cuz you'll

484
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,253
forget, oops, and during preparing,

485
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,223
I accidentally accessed one of my outlets. Especially since,

486
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,093
when you're preparing, you kinda want the outlets because

487
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,863
you're trying to prepare the UI. But you have to get used

488
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,998
to this fact that this happens before. I'm not sure

489
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,700
why they made the decision to do this, but

490
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,336
it can be a pain. I mean,

491
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,939
sometimes when you prepare the MVC that you're preparing,

492
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,874
it's just collecting the information. And

493
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,876
then, in its view did load, which is a function, remember,

494
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,680
that we know is called after our outlets are hooked up.

495
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,816
Then you talk to the outlets and parcel out the information

496
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,485
or whatever. So it can be annoying.

497
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,755
But I'll intentionally crash in the demo, just so

498
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,725
you can see this happening, because it will happen to you.

499
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,262
All right, so that's prepare for segue. You can

500
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,765
prevent a segue from happening with this method

501
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,300
shouldPerformSegue in UIViewController.

502
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,170
Okay, you get the identifier, if you return false from this,

503
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,672
then the segue will not happen.

504
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,207
So some will click on that graph button, the system looks

505
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,511
at this method. If it says no, then it will not segue

506
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,047
to a new graph controller. It's just like you never even

507
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:47,217
clicked on that button. This is pretty rare to do,

508
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,120
but occasionally, you might wanna do it. All right,

509
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,622
so let's see a demo of all the stuff.

510
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,624
I'm probably gonna show you all this stuff in here.

511
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:58,762
I think we have time for all of that. Yeah, we probably do.

512
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:03,600
All right, so let's head back over to our Concentration. So

513
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,137
what I'm gonna do here, this is Concentration as we left it

514
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,140
off last time. I'm gonna change it to have multiple

515
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,343
MVCs, so the new MVC I'm gonna add is a theme chooser.

516
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,647
Remember how you all in your homework added theme to your

517
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,751
Concentration game? You did, but it chose a random theme.

518
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,021
So I'm gonna add a theme mechanism to mine, a simple

519
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,524
one because it's a demo. And then, but I'm gonna have

520
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:32,695
another MVC that lets me choose the theme. So, let's do

521
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:37,200
that. Let's start by one thing I wanna do in here after I've

522
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,170
been putting off, but I wanna do is now that I have multiple

523
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:44,040
MVCs, I do not want any of my MVCs to have their controller

524
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,611
called view controller. Okay, that's just way too generic.

525
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,645
Okay, I'm gonna have multiple MVCs.

526
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,148
I want each one to have the class of controls.

527
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,017
It'd be, you know, nicely named. So here,

528
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:59,723
I'm going to go, Oops, controller here.

529
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,292
And I'm gonna rename this. And the way to rename this,

530
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,928
you can't just type in a new name here.

531
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,697
Because this also appears in the storyboard by name.

532
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,133
Everything in the storyboard is by name. So

533
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:14,871
the way to rename here is to do the special Cmd+Click,

534
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,474
remember that menu? And choose Rename and

535
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:22,145
the Xcode will go and look at all the places that is used.

536
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,113
And now I'll just type in,

537
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,148
I'm gonna call this my ConcentrationViewController.

538
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:31,020
Because it's the view controller that controls this

539
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:36,827
view controller right here, my Concentration game, all right?

540
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:43,100
Okay, so let's go and add this theme support to my app.

541
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,769
I'm gonna do it super simply. Here's where all my emoji

542
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:49,373
stuff is. I'm just gonna add a var called theme, which I'm

543
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,309
gonna have be an optional string, which is one of these.

544
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,814
Okay, so my theme, when you set my theme, you just set

545
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,817
the emoji you want, and that is the theme. Okay, so like,

546
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,619
this would be the Halloween theme if we pasted in here.

547
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,621
And when its didSet happens,

548
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,892
I'm just gonna reset my emoji choices to equal this theme.

549
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,660
By the way, this is an optional.

550
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,330
It's gonna start out nil, and if you set it to nil,

551
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,433
then I'll just have no emoji as your theme.

552
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,735
In which case, you're gonna end up getting this question

553
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,204
mark if you'll remember, if you don't have any emoji.

554
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,340
And then I'm also gonna reset the emoji that we have used so

555
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,910
far because it might be from a different theme.

556
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,078
So I'm gonna reset it, and by the way,

557
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,882
all I need to do to create an empty dictionary is that

558
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,818
because Swift is gonna be able to infer the type from this.

559
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,588
So I don't need to put card and string in here.

560
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,791
And finally, what if someone sets my theme, and

561
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,027
I'm in the middle of a game? I think I'd better update my

562
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,664
view from my model. Okay, remember updateViewFromModel,

563
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,468
so that whatever is showing, if it's got the wrong theme,

564
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:55,071
will update to my new theme. Okay, so that's it.

565
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,074
That's how I'm gonna do my theme. it's really simple,

566
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,211
probably a little too simple. Another thing I'm gonna do is

567
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,449
that, since we now let the theme be set, I really don't

568
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,651
want this Halloween color theme here. So I'm gonna

569
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,090
change all these things to be a more kind of standard color.

570
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,759
Blue, blue is this default blue right here is

571
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,428
probably one of the most standard colors, so

572
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:22,098
let's make everything here be blue. I'll have to change up

573
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:27,704
my code as well, easy to change here. All right,

574
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,240
and then, the background doesn't wanna be black,

575
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,243
it's very unusual, we're gonna make that white. And

576
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,511
then our flips down here wants to be black,

577
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,483
just standard color black, where's black, there it is.

578
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,786
So now our UI looks a little more standard color.

579
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:46,489
Let's go do the same thing in our code over here.

580
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,024
Concentration ViewController,

581
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,559
see we've got these colors here,

582
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,061
so this orange right here,

583
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,696
which is the back of the cards, we'll make that blue.

584
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,965
We don't want the card's background to be white, and so

585
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,367
our overall background is white.

586
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,769
So I'll just make it be light gray, so

587
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,137
that we can see the edges of the cards better. And

588
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,407
then I also, we have our flip count label,

589
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,709
we'll make that be black. Okay, so I've added the theme,

590
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,846
I've changed my color scheme. Let's just run and make

591
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,383
sure I haven't broken anything here before we dive in.

592
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,557
Okay, so we got this blue theme, and

593
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,260
we got the Halloween default, kind of our default theme,

594
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,697
looks like it is functioning properly.

595
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,732
We're even getting our outline font. And

596
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,803
we've got normal colors here. Okay, so now let's go and

597
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,139
add this other MVC, right? We've got this MVC,

598
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,477
we need another one. How do we add an MVC to our app? Well,

599
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,913
we just go over here, same place that we get a button or

600
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,749
a label from. The very top one is View Controller.

601
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,085
I just drag it out and drop it in.

602
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,923
So now I have two MVCs, two view controllers here.

603
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,325
We call these things, by the way,

604
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:59,929
each one of these things a scene, S-C-E-N-E, scene. Okay,

605
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,266
so, we, we have these two view controllers right here,

606
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,936
two MVCs, and one, a couple things I need to do here.

607
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,273
One is, every time I have a view controller, it needs

608
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,476
a view controller subclass to control it. This one has one,

609
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,879
ConcentrationViewController. We need to make one for

610
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,549
here. And I do that with File > New File.

611
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,551
That's always how I create a new class. And

612
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,287
it's a UI thing, so I'm gonna do Cocoa Touch Class.

613
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,289
It's a subclass of UIViewController.

614
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:32,228
I'm gonna call this my ConcentrationThemeChooserView-

615
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,531
Controller. Nice long name right there, won't have to

616
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,001
type it very much though. And I'm gonna make sure not to put

617
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,738
it at the level of my project. I'm gonna put it down a level,

618
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:46,310
where all my files are, are there. And here we go.

619
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,445
This is our viewController. We're gonna get rid of

620
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,014
these viewController lifecycle methods like we always do.

621
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,383
And that leaves us with this one method,

622
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,720
all important prepare(for segue. So we will get back

623
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:01,158
to prepare(for segue) there, and implement it quite soon.

624
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,259
But the first thing we just do is the same thing you did

625
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:07,130
when you dragged out a blank UI view. What did you do?

626
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,100
You went to the identity inspector over here. And

627
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,835
you changed its identity to be your custom subclass.

628
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,339
So we wanna do the same thing here. So I'm gonna select this

629
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,241
guy, I'm gonna go here to the identity inspector.

630
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,178
I'm gonna change it from being just generic UIViewController

631
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,714
to being my ConcentrationThemeChooser

632
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,784
ViewController. Okay, don't forget that step.

633
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,153
If you don't do that step, then your prepare(for segue),

634
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,688
for example, will never get called.

635
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,457
You won't be able to create any outlets, or any actions,

636
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,427
or anything. You need to do that. Another thing I'm gonna

637
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,230
do is this little arrow, you see this arrow right here?

638
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,932
This is the arrow that says when this app runs,

639
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,369
which view controller do I show first? Okay, and

640
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:49,305
obviously now, I wanna show the theme one first. So

641
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,241
I just, you can just pick this up and drag it to whatever MVC

642
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,079
you want to be the first one. All right, so here's my theme

643
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,148
chooser right here. If we were really doing this for real,

644
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,619
this would probably be a table view. Or some extensible list

645
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,321
of themes, that I could add more themes to with one line

646
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,524
of code, like you were asked to do do in your homework.

647
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,159
But I haven't taught you table view yet, so I can't do it

648
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,696
that way. Instead, I'm just gonna have three buttons,

649
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,432
each of which is a theme. So, I'm just gonna grab three

650
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,302
buttons here, and make this nice UI to this MVC.

651
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:23,473
We'll make the font nice and big, so you can see it.

652
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,611
Go over here, and maybe 40 points or something like that.

653
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,014
And we need three of them so I'll copy and paste,

654
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,884
and then paste another one. Okay, so,

655
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,856
the three themes that I have, I have a Sports theme,

656
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:45,395
I have a Faces theme, and I have an Animals Theme. So

657
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,965
these are my themes. Lets do a quick review of auto layout.

658
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,768
I'm going to select these and put them in a stack, with this

659
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,470
button down here. Then in stack view, here they are.

660
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,806
I'm going to make them be centered in the stack.

661
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,209
And I'm going to make them be equal size.

662
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,578
And I'm going to pick a standard spacing, like that.

663
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,181
I'm also going to put this in the center,

664
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,517
and do my control drag to my outer level, and

665
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:11,321
have the center, horizontal and vertical there.

666
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,324
Notice I get the yellow. That yellow is just warning me,

667
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:19,529
that these frames will be different at run time.

668
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,465
I can fix that in the document outline.

669
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,833
If you'll recall this little guy right here,

670
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,903
with this yellow button in the upper right, and go here, and

671
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,105
then click on anything that's yellow. And

672
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,242
it can fix the misplacement for me by updating the frame,

673
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,545
so we'll do that. It moved it slightly, and

674
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:39,515
now everything is resolved. Okay, so this is great.

675
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,019
I got my nice UI here, I've got auto layouts, so

676
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,055
it should work when I rotate, and do all those things. So,

677
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,692
now all I need to do is wire these two MVCs up. Okay,

678
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,661
make it so that when I click on one of these buttons,

679
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,464
it shows this MVC over here on the right. And I

680
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,000
do that with control drag. So, I'm just gonna control drag

681
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:00,236
from the sports button over here. I'm gonna put this

682
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,973
in a navigation controller to start anyway.

683
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,541
So I'm gonna pick Show here, not Show Detail which is for

684
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,344
split views, I'm gonna pick Show. Okay, let's do the same

685
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,180
thing with this one. That's also gonna be a Show, and

686
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:15,918
this one here also a Show, so they're all going to Show. And

687
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,088
I want to make sure to click on each one of them,

688
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,425
it's nice it shows you what's causing the segue here, and

689
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,860
go over here to the inspector and

690
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,430
change the identifier. What does this segue do?

691
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,933
It basically let's you choose a theme, so

692
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,569
I'm going to call this Choose Theme, and I'm gonna

693
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,239
call all three of them, identify with Choose Theme,

694
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,242
because all three of them do exactly the same thing.

695
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,212
They choose a theme, all right?

696
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,448
Now I'm gonna do something kind of bad, in fact not kind

697
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:49,018
of bad, very bad, which is I'm gonna look at the button

698
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,589
that caused the segue to decide which theme to show.

699
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,491
Can anyone think of why that would be really bad?

700
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,596
Should never do that, no guesses? Because, what happens

701
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:05,235
when I convert this to French, or Chinese? Am I gonna have my

702
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,103
code have to have French, and Chinese in it so

703
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:10,039
that it works in those languages, no makes no sense?

704
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,609
So you never really want to drive your code from something

705
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:13,310
that's in the UI,

706
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,311
cuz your UI is gonna be in 40 different languages,

707
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,680
you hope if your app is successful. But for

708
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,250
downloads it's really good, because it's very little code,

709
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,619
and I can do it quickly. So this is download ware,

710
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,822
do not copy this aspect of what we're doing today.

711
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,259
All right, so we have created these segues right here.

712
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,928
Lets go ahead and run and see.

713
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:35,098
Wait, one more thing we have to do. We're missing an MVC.

714
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:38,168
We've got the first card on our stack, the second card of

715
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,169
our stack, but we don't have the stack itself.

716
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,039
We never have put a navigation control, which we could get

717
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,576
from here by the way. If you go down and look here, right

718
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,245
here navigation controller. I could just drag it out, and

719
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,747
then control drag to wire it up, but

720
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,115
I'm going to use that embed that I was telling you about.

721
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,818
So I'm just selecting this view controller, and

722
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,822
doing editor, embed in, navigation controller.

723
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,493
Now we have three MVCs here okay,

724
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:06,028
the navigation controller, the first card on the stack, and

725
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:10,467
then the one that we're going to push on to the stack Okay,

726
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,335
are we cool with that? All right so now let's run,

727
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,171
and notice it automatically moved the arrow when I

728
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,842
embedded that, which is kinda nice. So,

729
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,945
let's hope this works, and see what happens.

730
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,682
All right here's our UI, all right. Okay, it came into

731
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,619
the right space at least which is our chooser. Let's see if

732
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,222
when we choose one of these themes, if it will segue to

733
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,092
that other MVC. In fact let's move it out of the way, so we

734
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:41,131
can see what's going on here. Ready go, woo hoo it did it.

735
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,535
But, the theme is Halloween. So, how about animals,

736
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,707
still Halloween. So of course this is still Halloween,

737
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,409
because we never did anything to actually

738
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:57,147
prepare that MVC to be one of these themes, right? We just

739
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,515
put the name here, we didn't actually do the prepare. So,

740
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,652
our next step is to prepare this MVC, that gets put on to

741
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,423
the top of the stack of cards to have the right theme.

742
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,958
So, we're gonna prepare that. So, let's go do that. And

743
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:13,062
we do that in the code of the ConcentrationThemeChooserView-

744
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,565
Controller, right? That's the controller that we're choosing

745
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,034
the theme. So, let's uncomment out

746
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,736
this all-important function right here. And

747
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,672
get rid of the comments. And we gotta implement prepare.

748
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,241
So, what do we have to do to implement prepare?

749
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,844
Well, the first thing, as I've talked about before,

750
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,947
is we're gonna check to see which segue we're doing.

751
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,284
Now, we only have one kind of segue. So let's check for it,

752
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,821
and if the identifier equals the Choose Theme segue,

753
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,357
that's what we put in the inspector,

754
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:46,029
remember in the storyboard. Then we want to see if we can

755
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,200
find the Concentration game MVC and

756
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,369
prepare it by telling it its theme. So,

757
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,338
let's get the theme. How are we gonna get the theme?

758
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:59,642
Well, to speed things up I actually created a little

759
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,979
code snippet here, that creates this dictionary. So

760
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,248
this dictionary, it's just got the name of the theme,

761
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,584
which is the same as the button title,

762
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,352
that's why I'm saying that's bad design, and

763
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,455
then the theme itself. All right so there's sports,

764
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,622
there's a bunch of animals,

765
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,594
there's a bunch of faces. Okay so, we want to get that theme.

766
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:21,297
So, we're going to get the name of theme from the button.

767
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,899
That's this sender argument, the sender is the thing

768
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,470
causing this segue. So, we want to say something like,

769
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:32,408
if we can let the themeName equal the sender's

770
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:37,380
currentTitle, then we're gonna get the theme from that. But,

771
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:41,685
this we can't do because sender, what type is sender?

772
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:47,056
It's of type Any, optional Any, in fact.

773
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,192
You can't send an optional Any with the method currentTitle,

774
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,028
that's a button method.

775
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:55,698
Okay, so we're gonna have to use as, any time we see Any

776
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,835
we're almost always gonna have to use as. So I'm gonna say,

777
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:03,573
if I can let button equal the sender as a UI button,

778
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:09,345
then I can do this theme main thing. Because I now have

779
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,983
a var of this button which is of type, Button, UIbutton,

780
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:18,854
all right. So, now I can say button.currentTitle. So you

781
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,358
see how we used as to resolve that ending right there.

782
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,895
Now that we have the theme name, I can say if I can let

783
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:30,433
the theme equal my themes sub theme name.

784
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,137
Then I'm ready to go to prepare, right?

785
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,473
And we're just looking at this theme as this. So

786
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,009
I'm looking it up, and we know that that can fail of course,

787
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,878
because maybe this theme name is not in this dictionary. So

788
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,882
that's why we if let. By the way, these two if lets are so

789
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,119
related to each other we would almost certainly go up here,

790
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:53,822
and put them on the same line with a comma. Cuz they really,

791
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,058
really go together. By the way,

792
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,726
we probably wouldn't do this line either.

793
00:39:56,795 --> 00:40:00,229
We'd take this and put it right here.

794
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,564
In fact, I'll show you how to do that.

795
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,733
So, instead of creating a separate bar here, I would

796
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,337
just take this right here out of that, get rid of this,

797
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:12,475
put parentheses around this. Since this could return nil

798
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,947
I need to optional chain it. And now I can get rid of

799
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:22,385
all this. This is how we would write this code right here.

800
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,153
We wouldn't have all those extra if lets,

801
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,255
we try to make this concise because this is all

802
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,525
has to do with the same thing which is getting this theme.

803
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,361
If you didn't understand what I did right here.

804
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,597
Ask on Piazza, go to a TA, go back and do your reading

805
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,501
assignment, this is important to understand what's going on

806
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,271
here. Alright, so I got this, now I've got the theme,

807
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,106
now I need to prepare the destination.

808
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,476
So I'd like to say something like segue.destination,

809
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:51,781
set your theme to be this theme. Oops,

810
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,018
not that theme, this theme. But I can't do that either.

811
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,954
Because again, this segue destination,

812
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,523
let's look at the type of this segue destination.

813
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:04,160
Option click on it. It took type UI view controller.

814
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:07,430
And of course, UI view controller does not have

815
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,133
the var theme so we can't do that.

816
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:15,404
So we have to say here use as and say if we can let CVC,

817
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,341
Concentration view controller, equal the segue destination as

818
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,913
downcasted to a Concentration view controller. Now we can

819
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,417
compare, prepare this thing by setting it's theme.

820
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,390
Everyone see that? See how we're using as to downcast?

821
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,825
Super important to understand that. So now that's it,

822
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:40,930
we have successfully prepared this thing. So let's go,

823
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:48,270
run our app, see how it works. Okay,

824
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:53,877
hopefully Sports. No, what's going on? My app crashed.

825
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:59,482
Why did my app crash? No, Let's take a look and

826
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,584
see if we can find out here. It says,

827
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:05,154
unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value.

828
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:08,257
And here's my call stack here on the left and it looks like

829
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:13,729
card buttons here. My outlet to all my card buttons is nil.

830
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:19,435
Let's make sure that's true. PO card buttons nil,

831
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:22,337
no. So, let's go back up to call stack and

832
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:25,474
see how we got here. Okay, so we're in update view for

833
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,878
model. That got called from setting the theme.

834
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,112
Cuz when we set our theme we update

835
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:33,783
the view from model. And that theme setting got called for

836
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:37,519
preparing. So, the preparing is work it's trying to prepare

837
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,223
it in setting the theme. But when it sets the theme it

838
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,426
calls updateViewFromModel which tries to access the card

839
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,495
buttons which is nil, because of that red on the slide.

840
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,399
Which is that your outlets are not set when you're preparing.

841
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:54,770
Okay, so what do we do about this. Unfortunately,

842
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,506
even though this is an implicitly unwrapped optional,

843
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,276
we're gonna have to check and see if cardButtons does not

844
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,179
equal nil. And if cardButtons does not equal nil,

845
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,382
then we can update our view from our model. But

846
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,952
if it's not nil then we, if it's nil then we simply just

847
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:13,656
can't do this. Now, hopefully, somewhere later in our code

848
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:17,259
either in viewed load or case, when someone touches a card,

849
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,695
update view from model happens.

850
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,298
And so, everything's gonna be fine, cuz all the cards

851
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,067
are faced down until someone touches one, so we're good to

852
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:28,103
go. So it's very important to understand, you've got to

853
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,639
protect your code that can be called when your MVC is being

854
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:38,214
prepared. Okay, now, let's try again.

855
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,916
Let's try Sports. All right, it segued.

856
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,553
Let's cross our fingers that these are sports related, and

857
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,324
they are, excellent. The game is working just fine. Let's go

858
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,460
back, we're gonna hit back, when I hit back, that sports

859
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:55,865
game got thrown away. So now, when I pick animals, and

860
00:43:55,933 --> 00:44:00,336
go forward, look, brand new MVC. Game started over, and

861
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:04,540
it's animals, so that's good. Go back over here, Faces.

862
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:08,877
Brand new MVC. Segueing always creates a brand new MVC.

863
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:13,816
It's a very good example of that happening,

864
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:17,653
all right. Now let's do iPad. This is the first time we've

865
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:18,854
done iPad in this course and

866
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,923
you're going to be doing it from here on out and

867
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,526
you're going to have to do it in your next assignment. So

868
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,629
let's do this, let's take the app that we have right now and

869
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:31,867
see what it would look like in our story board on an iPad. So

870
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,970
here we're looking at it in iPhone X view here,

871
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,107
I'm just gonna switch over and look at it as an iPad.

872
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,976
And you can see that as an iPad it's really large so

873
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,978
maybe I wanna zoom out a little bit so

874
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,515
I can see it a little better. And this UI doesn't look very

875
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:50,019
good. Look at all this extra white space around.

876
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:53,188
If I had an iPad app and it looked like this, I'd be like,

877
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,425
this is a terrible design. And it's kind of a waste because

878
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:59,262
we really would a split view where this is on the left and

879
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,395
this is on the right.

880
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,599
That would be a much more effective use of the space,

881
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,802
especially in landscape. Imagine this in landscape

882
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,838
with this part on the left and this on the right,

883
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,840
that would be really good use of space there.

884
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,111
Okay, so that's what we wanna do. How are we gonna do that?

885
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,246
Of course, we need a split-view controller for

886
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,782
that. Now, I recommend anytime you add a split-view

887
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:23,118
controller to your app, that you zoom way out.

888
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,722
Okay, really, really far out. And that's because when you go

889
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,391
over here to grab one of these split views and you get all

890
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,561
those extra views that come with it, it's gonna be really

891
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,632
big. See, so it's nice to have your scale be small.

892
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:39,201
So I'm gonna drop this in here. And you can see this

893
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,871
has dropped the split view controller here. And

894
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,141
then it gave me a navigation controller and a master and

895
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,310
a detail. Okay, I don't want any of those things.

896
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:49,912
So I'm just gonna select them and delete.

897
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,215
Right, cuz I already have my master, it's right here, and

898
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,986
I have my detail right here. So let's move this up, if I

899
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,921
can grab a hold of it it's so small. So we can do that and

900
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,559
I'm even gonna move my detail, right here. If I can grab it,

901
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:06,562
it's hard to get a hold of it when it's small.

902
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,364
Over to here so that I can easily control drags. So let's

903
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,468
zoom back in now that we've collected everything here.

904
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,771
Get that out of there. And two things I want to do, one,

905
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,541
I want to get this arrow to be here on the split view

906
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,178
controller so that my app starts with the split view

907
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:25,748
controller. Doesn't start with the master showing.

908
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:28,517
Then I'm just going to control drag to my master and

909
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,553
choose master view controller right here. And then I'm gonna

910
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,924
control drag to my detail and choose Detail View Controller.

911
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,094
Now notice I still have these segues right here.

912
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,631
So my master when I'm clicking these is still trying to segue

913
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,234
to this view controller. So let's just run on an iPhone,

914
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,737
on an iPad rather and see if this works on iPad.

915
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,538
We put it in a split view. Let's just try it.

916
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:54,277
Let's see what's going on here. Okay so

917
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,046
here's my iPad, wahoo, it looks like it's working,

918
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,948
right? We've got our master on the left we've got our game

919
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,251
here on the right, okay, looking good.

920
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,989
Let's go ahead and choose a theme. Oops,

921
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:11,060
that's not good. That's not what we want. Look at that.

922
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,929
Now why is that happening. When I click Choose This,

923
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,633
I want this over here to change to a new sports game.

924
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,168
Why am I getting it in here? Well,

925
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,371
that's because of the type of these segues.

926
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,340
You see these segues? They're all Show Segues.

927
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:29,946
Show Segues mean do the navigation controller's trick.

928
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:34,416
I want show detail, also know as replace because it

929
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:37,253
replaces the detail view of your split view. Now,

930
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,622
you might think let's just change it, oops we changed it.

931
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,994
Okay, there is a bug interface builder, this does not work.

932
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:49,431
So do not try to just change your kind here.

933
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,967
I'm not sure under what circumstances it doesn't work,

934
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,636
but it often does not work. So what we're gonna do is delete

935
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,772
them. I'm just selecting them all and hitting Delete. And

936
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,876
I'm gonna rewire them up. It's a simple matter to rewire them

937
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:03,278
up. And this time I'm gonna choose Show Detail.

938
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,980
It lets me show you acquiring it and

939
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,883
hitting Show Detail, which is kind of a nice side effect.

940
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:10,852
I'm gonna wire all three of these up, and

941
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:14,689
which is not that bad. But, unfortunately, I also

942
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,593
have to inspect them all right here and

943
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,564
put the identifier back into steam for all three.

944
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,039
And you can see that all three of them are of kind show

945
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:33,408
detail now. Show detail, show detail, show detail. So

946
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,978
now when we run it's gonna work.

947
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,084
Okay, here we go, cross our fingers. So

948
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:46,989
we've got this is the Halloween style. And sports.

949
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:51,827
Now again, it created a new game, hopefully with sports.

950
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:56,932
Animals, new game with animals.

951
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:00,202
Now, the real question here is did we break the iPhone

952
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,938
version here? Cuz we did a lot of iPad work here.

953
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,206
We added this split view,

954
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,076
which we know doesn't work on an iPhone at least not in

955
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:10,745
iPhone Plus. And we changed these segues to be

956
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:15,083
Show Detail. And the iPhone can't show split views, so

957
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,219
it can't show detail. Did this break everything?

958
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:21,690
And the answer is no. Because iOS is really smart and

959
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:24,460
it knows that if this structure of having a split

960
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,328
view with a navigation controller inside it,

961
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:30,299
even with Show Detail things. That when we're on the iPhone,

962
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:35,504
this means do it all in a navigation controller. So

963
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:39,808
this is called adapting to a different trait collection.

964
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:41,543
And we'll talk about that when we talk more

965
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:45,847
about auto layout. But here's our UI appearing here.

966
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,817
One thing interesting to notice here, it didn't come up

967
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:54,223
showing the Themes, it came up showing again with the default

968
00:49:54,292 --> 00:50:00,061
theme. Now I can go back and choose a theme and it worked.

969
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,899
But interestingly it comes up when. When it first comes up,

970
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:06,067
it comes up with this default theme. And

971
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,371
that's just a decision they made, some apps want this,

972
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,973
some apps don't. I guess Apple figured this is the most

973
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,443
common one. In our example, we don't want that.

974
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,746
We would want it coming up with this, right? So

975
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:21,283
if we have time in our demo, we'll fix that. So to do that,

976
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,485
we have to become the split view's delegate so

977
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,687
it's a little bit of complicated work.

978
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,657
The code's not complicated, but being a delegate, you guys

979
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:32,027
have not seen much yet, so we would have to do that. But

980
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,696
otherwise, notice that it's working just fine.

981
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,032
Okay, and notice that in landscape on an iPhone,

982
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,534
it does not do the side-by-side split view thing.

983
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,871
It uses the whole screen. However, on an iPhone Plus,

984
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,307
like let's look at the iPhone 8 Plus and

985
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,978
run it there. On pluses, it does do the split view.

986
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,481
You see? This is doing the split view here,

987
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,852
faces, sports. So it's doing the split view here.

988
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,356
But in Portrait mode, it does navigation controller. See

989
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:04,426
look there's a Back button. I can't slide out from the left,

990
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:07,028
when I pull out from the left it goes back in the navigation

991
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:12,401
controller. So an iPhone Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 7 Plus,

992
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:16,872
those are kinda hybrid devices half way between an iPad and

993
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,876
iPhone. All right, let's take this one step further and

994
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,946
put this whole thing in a tab bar controller. Just so

995
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,117
you can see what this looks like. Again, really easy.

996
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,819
I'm gonna zoom way out again. Anytime I drag these view

997
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,254
controllers out they bring a bunch of extra junk. So

998
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,525
here's a tab bar controller. I just drag it out. Here it is.

999
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,360
It brings it out. I don't know if you can see it.

1000
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,997
But it actually gave me two little blank view controllers

1001
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:44,933
right there, which I'll go ahead and leave.

1002
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:48,003
I'll just leave them there. It has three tabs total.

1003
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:49,672
So let's see if we can get hold of this and

1004
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,839
drag this up here. So

1005
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:54,142
I'm gonna leave these two that are brought out as tabs and

1006
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,379
then I'm gonna control drag to my split view to make it be

1007
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:01,149
relationship view controller here that's how you add it.

1008
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,919
It's not a segue. It's just adding it as a view controller

1009
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:07,522
right there. And we can zoom in see what it

1010
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:11,293
did there. Here's my tab bar controller. If you zoom

1011
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,795
in you can see it says tab bar controller right there. And,

1012
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,698
of course, I wanna move this little arrow arrow to here so

1013
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,467
it starts in the tab bar controller.

1014
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:23,872
You can set the attributes about that the little tab has,

1015
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,707
here in the storyboard if you want. You see right here?

1016
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:28,009
If you click on it. Like this is my Concentration game so

1017
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:32,581
I can say Concentration. These ones that it added down here,

1018
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,816
lets see what it has for them, maybe we'll just leave it.

1019
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:39,287
It has item one. And item two are the two things that has,

1020
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,124
we'll just leave it like that. And you can click on these and

1021
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:46,761
not just set the name that it uses.

1022
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,531
Where are we? So when you zoomed in it's hard to find

1023
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,332
where the heck you are.

1024
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:53,235
So that's when we often zoom way out. So we can also click

1025
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,404
on this thing and set things like the image.

1026
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,506
By the way, this image that goes into this tab bar item.

1027
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,843
Okay, it's an alpha only image. So all the drawing you

1028
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,312
do is either with transparent pixels or opaque ones.

1029
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,349
And if they're transparent, then kind of iOS is gonna

1030
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,985
shine light through those transparent pixels and

1031
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,520
that's what's gonna show up as your tab bar.

1032
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:16,157
The other thing you can do that's kinda cool is you can

1033
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,526
reorder the tabs. So here I've got my three tabs,

1034
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,397
Item 1, Item 2. Let's move our Concentration one to be

1035
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:25,934
the left most tab. Okay, so let's run it again. We'll do

1036
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:31,707
it on an iPhone 8 Plus. It doesn't really matter. Okay,

1037
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,076
here we go. You can barely see these tabs on the bottom.

1038
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:35,444
I don't know if it helps to make it any bigger.

1039
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,813
But there they are. There's the Concentration tab.

1040
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,183
Here's Item 1 tab. Here's Item 2.

1041
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,151
They're blank. If we go back to Concentration,

1042
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,520
we still have our full UI here. Okay,

1043
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,990
it's just in a tab right there and same thing if we rotate.

1044
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,261
Got the three tabs here. Okay, so that's bar. So

1045
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,633
it's really, really simple. Okay. Lets talk about another

1046
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:01,804
little bit wonky thing with this app that we have.

1047
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:05,874
I'm going to run it on the iPad again. And just note that

1048
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,610
it does. Actually before I do that even I'm going to do one

1049
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:13,181
other thing which is lets show you how to make a segue from

1050
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,419
code. Okay so the segues that we have here are just directly

1051
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,821
from these buttons like if I click on a segue it's directly

1052
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,759
from a button to the MVC. There is a way to make it so

1053
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:27,896
that you do this performed segue business in code without

1054
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,699
performed segue lines. So to show that I'm going to delete

1055
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:34,069
these segues. So now the buttons no longer segue and

1056
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:38,240
instead I'm gonna segue from code. And I'm gonna do that by

1057
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,909
changing these buttons. Instead of being seguers,

1058
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:43,011
they're going to do target action. So

1059
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,048
lets just bring them up here. Zoom in a little bit. And

1060
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,516
just do our normal target action.

1061
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,186
So this is nothing different than you been doing target

1062
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:53,889
action all quarter long. I'm just gonna control drag

1063
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,358
from the button here, and create an action.

1064
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:59,261
I am going to call this action ChangeTheme,

1065
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:02,097
because that's what it's going to do. Just for fun,

1066
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:06,201
you know where usually I say, set this UI Button or else.

1067
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,437
Well, actually now you don't need to set that UI Button or

1068
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,439
else because you know how to deal with Any. So

1069
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:12,508
I am going to connect this with any as the argument.

1070
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:15,210
Okay the sender instead of being UI Button its Any,

1071
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,212
and you know how to deal with that now. Okay,

1072
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,747
you didn't before, but now you know,

1073
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:21,950
with the as you can deal with that. And we'll put on that,

1074
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,554
we'll have all three buttons send the same thing right

1075
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:28,690
here. So I'm gonna put a choose theme segue in here,

1076
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:30,659
but its not gonna be from a particular button.

1077
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:34,863
It just gonna be a segue from this view controller to this

1078
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:38,233
view controller. So it's kind of like a generic segue

1079
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:41,536
between these two. So how do you create a segue like that?

1080
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:44,306
Well, you control drag like a buttons,

1081
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,309
but instead of control dragging from some UI element

1082
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,711
You control drag from this little round yellow thing.

1083
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,913
You see that's just Concentration theme control.

1084
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:56,018
This right here represents this MVC. This is the thing

1085
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,553
you can use to drag from or to, to mean this MVC.

1086
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,390
So, I am going to control drag from here

1087
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,593
to here. Okay, it's going to be showed detail, because we

1088
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,995
are in a split view context. I am gonna go here and

1089
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:11,466
still give it a name. The same name, choose theme, and now,

1090
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,968
I've created a segue between this view controller and

1091
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,603
this view controller, not between these buttons.

1092
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,338
See when I click on these buttons, or

1093
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,474
when I click on this it's not selecting these buttons.

1094
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,143
It's selecting the whole view controller.

1095
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,779
So, this is how you do a manual segue. You create

1096
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,616
a segue between the two view controllers. And then, in your

1097
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:31,720
code you just say performSegue with that theme name.

1098
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:55,577
Okay, or you may, or may not want a segue here.

1099
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:58,080
Now, you can also use that should perform segue method to

1100
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,715
conditionally segue, but I'm gonna show you how we can do

1101
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,484
conditional segue right here,

1102
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:06,621
a really good example of it. So, let's go back to our iPad

1103
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,491
Pro that we had running here. And I'm gonna put a cool

1104
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,528
feature in here, which is if I'm in the middle of a game,

1105
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,465
and I hate sports, it's not going to replace this.

1106
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,402
It's going to actually change the theme on the fly and

1107
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:24,138
not reset the game. Wouldn't that be a kind of better

1108
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,942
UI here? We don't really wanna start a new game every time we

1109
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,343
change the theme. So,

1110
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:31,312
if I am gonna do that, I can not segue.

1111
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:34,515
You see why I can't segue and do that? Because segue always

1112
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:38,987
create a new MVC, so there's no way for me to segue and

1113
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:42,790
keep this MVC like it is. So, I have to do this in code

1114
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:46,094
instead, so in change theme here, instead of segueing.

1115
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,698
I'm going to look in my split view controller, and

1116
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:54,803
find this find this little view controller over here,

1117
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,871
and talk to it directly. Just gonna talk to it,

1118
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,541
I'm not gonna segue to it, I'm gonna see if I can find it.

1119
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,276
And if I find it there, I'm just gonna talk to it,

1120
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:03,578
and tell it to change its theme. Okay, so

1121
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,279
how I'm gonna do that?

1122
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:07,182
So, now, I'm gonna put that code back that I deleted

1123
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:09,484
this themeName here. And

1124
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:14,989
if I have a theme, then inside here, okay, inside this

1125
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:18,627
thing I'm going to talk to the detail of my split view. So,

1126
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,295
this is gonna be a thing where if I'm in split view,

1127
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,463
and I can find my detail I'll just talk to it and

1128
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,100
tell it the theme otherwise, I'll do the performSegue.

1129
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,203
So, that's what I mean about conditional performSegue here.

1130
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:31,072
So, I'm gonna find out, find that split view controller by

1131
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,342
saying, if let cvc = and then I'm gonna create a little var,

1132
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:38,580
which is my splitViewDetailConcentrationV-

1133
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:43,819
iewController, which might be nil, if I can't find it. So,

1134
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,621
I'm going to do that, and then if I can find that,

1135
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,792
then I'll get the theme and set the CVCs theme equal

1136
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:55,463
to this theme. There we go,

1137
00:58:55,532 --> 00:59:00,869
like that. Else, I will perform segue. So, everyone

1138
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,038
see what I'm doing here. So, I just have to implement this.

1139
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,840
This is going to be a var that finds my split view

1140
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,843
detail controller as a concentration view controller.

1141
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,346
So, that's going to be a private var called this.

1142
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,649
Copy. Paste.

1143
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,219
It's going to be of type Concentration view controller,

1144
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,054
optional though, because I might not be able to find it.

1145
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:24,459
And I'm just gonna return the splitViewController I'm in if

1146
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:29,597
any, dot its viewControllers, which is the master,

1147
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:34,001
an array of the master and the detail, right? Dot last,

1148
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,407
which should be the detail as a ConcentrationViewController.

1149
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:41,609
So, if all the optional chaining, and

1150
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,277
then as make it through here,

1151
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,814
then I was able to find the ConcentratonViewController

1152
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,849
in my splitViewController's detail.

1153
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,085
See what I'm doing there? Okay, and

1154
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,722
if I'm able to do that, then I'll set the theme here.

1155
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,825
So, let's see if this works. All right, here we go,

1156
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,695
let's try it. So, we've got our Halloween theme here,

1157
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,662
that's great. Now, I'm gonna hit sports, hopefully,

1158
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,499
it will not reset the game, cuz it will hopefully find

1159
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:07,935
this Concentration view controller. Woo hoo! It just

1160
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,707
reset the theme, didn't reset the game, cuz we didn't segue.

1161
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:15,743
We did this, instead, of segueing. All right, what

1162
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,346
about this on the iPhone? This is going to work on iPhone?

1163
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:22,516
Let's go over there and see. Okay, so

1164
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,986
let's go back, actually, let's pick one here, let's say like,

1165
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:28,290
here's ours sports one. Now, let's go back and try and

1166
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:32,728
change it to animals and see. No, it didn't work.

1167
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:38,866
And why didn't it work? Because, oops.

1168
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,470
Sorry, because we only can do

1169
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:45,073
this if we're in a split view controller that has a detail

1170
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,942
view controller. And on the iPhone there is no detail in

1171
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,378
the split view controller. We use the navigation controller

1172
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:54,415
to get to it. So, how would we fix this on an iPhone? Well,

1173
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:59,721
on an iPhone what we are going to have to do is grab ahold of

1174
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:04,092
an MVC that we segue to, and hold on to it with a strong

1175
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,562
pointer. So, that when it gets thrown off the navigation

1176
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:10,398
stack it doesn't leave the heap and we will keep ahold

1177
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:13,701
of it. Then the next time someone wants to go to it,

1178
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,370
we will just put it straight on the navigation control.

1179
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,506
We will not segued to it, because that would reset it.

1180
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:20,208
We will just push it right on there, and

1181
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,977
it will show you how we do navigation

1182
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,012
controller direct pushing and popping.

1183
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,080
So, how are we going to do that? Well,

1184
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,949
I am just going to create a little private var here,

1185
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:33,120
which I am going to call my LastSeguedtToConcentrationVie-

1186
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:37,059
wController, which is going to be

1187
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:40,128
a ConcentrationViewController optional. And

1188
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,298
I'm just gonna set this any time I successfully

1189
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,333
segue to something. So,

1190
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:49,637
that becomes my last segue to concentration view controller.

1191
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,505
Right?, so I'm just grabbing onto it right there.

1192
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,309
This is a known normal var, so it's gonna be a strong pointer

1193
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,477
too. It's gonna keep it in the heap. So,

1194
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,246
even when we hit the back button,

1195
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,548
it'll get thrown off the navigation stack, but

1196
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:03,818
it'll stay in the heap, all right? Pointed to by this var.

1197
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,421
And then, over here, when we change theme, if I can't do

1198
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:10,759
the splitView trick, then I'm gonna say, else if I can let

1199
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:16,697
cvc equal that last segued of two thing. Then,

1200
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,100
I'm just gonna push it right unto the navigation stack.

1201
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:21,769
And remember how we do that from the slides? We just say,

1202
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,775
the navigation controller I'm in, if I'm in one,

1203
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:32,313
.pushviewController this last of the CVC actually.

1204
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,917
Animated? True. And lets make sure that we, of course,

1205
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:38,653
set it's theme. Got to copy and paste in code here, so

1206
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,556
we will want to clean that up a little bit.

1207
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:46,361
But we will set its theme here before we push. All right?

1208
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,796
So, a lot going on here.

1209
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,865
You're learning about how to find into a Split View.

1210
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,834
You're learning how to hold something in the heap that

1211
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:54,803
gets thrown off the navigation deck. You're learning how to

1212
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,138
push things on a navigation deck without segueing.

1213
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,907
And you're learning how to segue from code. All in this

1214
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,310
one method right here. So, let's go see if this worked.

1215
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:08,916
All right, here we go, so

1216
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,319
we'll pick a theme like maybe animals,

1217
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:14,322
here we go looking good. Now, let's go and

1218
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,892
change it to sports, go back here sports. Woo hoo,

1219
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,462
it worked, because we didn't segue to it the second time.

1220
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,532
The first time we segued to it and we grabbed it. And

1221
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:28,770
the next time, we just pushed it on the navigation stack,

1222
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:33,041
and set. We go can back and set it to, you know, sports,

1223
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:39,514
how about faces, animals. Okay? So, the last

1224
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:44,619
thing I'm going to do, and this one a little complicated.

1225
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Again, not complicated to implement, but it's using some

1226
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,458
concepts like delegation here that you're not quite used to.

1227
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,994
But I'm gonna make it so that when I run my iPhone version,

1228
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,598
it doesn't come up showing me a Concentration game that has

1229
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:02,704
the default Halloween. I want it to come up showing this.

1230
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:06,674
So, to do that, my ThemeChooserViewController

1231
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:10,411
here is gonna make itself the delegate of the split view

1232
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,048
controller that it's in. Remember that even on iPhone,

1233
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,849
it's still in split view controller even though it

1234
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:18,553
doesn't show it as split view controller. Now it turns out

1235
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,824
that one of the ten or so split view delegate methods is

1236
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:27,495
one that controls whether it collapses. The what he calls

1237
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,431
the secondary view controller, which is the detail.

1238
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,067
Whether it collapses it on top of the primary

1239
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:35,970
at any given time, in the running of the app. So we're

1240
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,372
just gonna implement that splitView delegate method.

1241
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,808
And we're gonna return some bool that says what to do.

1242
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,144
And we're just gonna tell it to do the right thing.

1243
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,414
So how do we do that? Well, first we have to set our self

1244
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,183
as the split view controller's delegate,

1245
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,852
and I'm gonna do that in that function awakeFromNib.

1246
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,021
I haven't had a chance to show you awakeFromNib.

1247
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,157
It's a function that's called on every object that comes out

1248
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,661
of your interface builder file. Here you would never,

1249
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,130
extremely unlikely that you would ever build this whole

1250
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,099
split view navigation controller tab bar thing

1251
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:08,269
in code, that would be a lot of messy code.

1252
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:10,304
You're gonna build it in a storyboard, so it's okay for

1253
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,840
me to do this little split view trick in awakeFromNib.

1254
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,075
I don't have to worry about

1255
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:17,645
this being created somewhere else. I'm just gonna tell

1256
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:22,450
my SplitViewController that I'm in, if I'm in one,

1257
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:26,053
to set it's delegate to be myself. So

1258
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,889
that it will call that method about the collapsing on top

1259
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,993
of, now of course it says you can't do this because it says

1260
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:36,130
self is not a UISplitViewControllerDelegate.

1261
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,901
So I have to go up here and announce that I am a

1262
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:44,739
UISplitViewControllerDelegate and all the methods in there

1263
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:47,007
are optional it's an Objective-C protocol.

1264
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,377
So I've implemented it, no warnings or

1265
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,713
errors everything's good. But of course I do need

1266
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,115
to actually implement one of them which is that collapse.

1267
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:55,216
And I don't remember what it's called but

1268
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,253
I know it has collapse in it, here it is right here it's

1269
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:03,391
this one. Okay, so I'll let you take a look at this guy.

1270
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:07,661
It's called UIViewController collapseSecondary onto

1271
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:12,433
primaryViewController. And this secondaryViewController

1272
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:15,203
is the detail, the primaryViewController is

1273
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,005
the master. And it's basically asking here,

1274
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,708
hey I'm adapting to the fact that I'm a splitViewController

1275
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:24,678
on an iPhone. And I want to collapse the detail, using

1276
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:27,282
the navigation controller, on top of the primary,

1277
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:31,219
the master. Should I do it. And unfortunately the return

1278
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,021
value of this seems like it should be true, do it.

1279
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,558
But actually, if we wanna prevent this from happening,

1280
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:41,195
we return true. And the reason that happens is if you return

1281
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:42,697
false from this method,

1282
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:46,234
you're basically saying I did not collapse this for you so

1283
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:49,403
you do it. So the return values are kind of inverse.

1284
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,640
But the bottom line is if we don't want that collapsing

1285
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:56,811
to happen, okay, we need to return true from this method.

1286
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,014
So when do we not want it to collapse? Well, we don't want

1287
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,950
it to collapse any time that secondaryViewController,

1288
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,286
that concentration game, has a nill theme.

1289
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,122
If it has a nil theme then the theme's never been set,

1290
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,926
we want, don't wanna do that collapse. So I'm just gonna

1291
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:16,264
say here, if I can let cvc = secondaryViewController as

1292
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:20,902
concentrationViewController. Then,

1293
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:26,106
if cve.theme==nil. So

1294
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:30,378
it's never been set, then I'm gonna return false. Otherwise,

1295
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:34,716
I'm just gonna return true, which says to the system true

1296
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,552
means yes, please do that collapse for me. Actually it's

1297
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,622
the other way around. See, I always get confused, true and

1298
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:44,992
false. So true means I did it. But I'm actually not going

1299
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,694
to do it. So it's not gonna get done.

1300
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:49,330
False means no, I didn't collapse it so

1301
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,599
you should do it. It's very confusing.

1302
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,167
Even I get confused between this true and false.

1303
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:58,139
But this is the way it is. So it's a little complicated.

1304
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,508
Little bit of advanced use of delegation there.

1305
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:04,578
But let's see if it works. So when we first run it worked,

1306
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,949
because that thing that would normally had put on there had

1307
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:11,252
a nil theme, which is using that default theme. But

1308
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,222
if I click, now it does collapse it on there because

1309
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,691
the theme is not nil. I set the theme to sports, right?

1310
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,261
So the now it's a sports theme. Let me go back here and

1311
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:23,031
now we're getting the reuse because we're not segwaying.

1312
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:28,436
Okay, all right so that's it, I showed you

1313
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:32,039
a lot of stuff about multiple MVCs there, right? So,

1314
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:35,043
you know, make sure you pile through this and understand it

1315
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,779
all because you're gonna be using it all pretty much in

1316
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,714
your next assignment right away. You're gonna have to do

1317
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,784
pretty much all of these stuff in your next assignment.

1318
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,153
All right, let's jump back into the slides and

1319
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,189
get as far as we can here with

1320
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:51,592
this animation thing. We only have about seven or eight

1321
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,428
minutes left, so we probably won't get all the way through.

1322
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,463
But that's okay, we'll just continue on Wednesday.

1323
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,133
Any questions about that MVC stuff?

1324
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:03,704
I didn't see any raised hands, so. Okay, timer, so timer,

1325
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:06,707
I'm talking about timer right before I talk about animation.

1326
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:09,210
Timer is not really used for animation.

1327
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,078
You wouldn't use a timer to do animation.

1328
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,315
But sometimes it's used in concert with animation. So

1329
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:16,050
I'm teaching it about the same time.

1330
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:19,554
Now some of you actually used timer in your extra credit.

1331
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,323
For assignment two I guess, I'm not sure, yes assignment

1332
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:26,427
two and timer is super simple little struct very,

1333
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,930
very simple struct. It's basically made for you to

1334
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,933
give it a closure, a little function which will execute

1335
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,635
sometime in the future. And you tell it how much,

1336
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:37,538
two seconds in the future, ten seconds, a minute, an hour,

1337
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:39,273
and it will go and execute that code.

1338
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,175
And it can do it every hour if you want or

1339
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:44,278
every two seconds or it can just do it one time.

1340
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:49,184
So how do we use Timer? The easiest way to use timer

1341
01:09:49,252 --> 01:09:52,053
is to use this class function on timer called

1342
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,189
scheduledTimer. It only has three arguments.

1343
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:58,959
One is the time interval to wait until it executes it,

1344
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,796
whether it repeats it, keeps doing it, and

1345
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:05,633
the block of code which is a simple little block that takes

1346
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:09,337
the timer as the argument and returns nothing. And

1347
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,973
it'll jut execute that code, so it could not be simpler.

1348
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,441
So here's an example of it,

1349
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,278
I have this private weak var, which is a timer, I'll

1350
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:19,880
explain why that's weak cuz this is the first time besides

1351
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,015
outlet that you've seen me use weak.

1352
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,052
And I just set that timer var equal to the results of

1353
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:28,189
calling Timer.scheduledTimer. Here I'm doing TimeInterval

1354
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:31,058
of two seconds and it does repeat. So every two seconds,

1355
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:34,028
it's going to implement your code here. And every time he

1356
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:36,497
calls it, you pass over the timer back to you so

1357
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,366
that you have a hand of these. I putting it in a var, so

1358
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:42,036
I wouldn't need it. But it's nice to put a passage over

1359
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,471
there in case you don't wanna store it around in a var.

1360
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,942
Now why did I make that weak.

1361
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:52,213
I make it weak because as soon as that timer stops running.

1362
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,348
Either because it wasn't a repeating timer or

1363
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,751
because someone stopped it from repeating.

1364
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,720
Then no one else will have a strong pointer to it. So

1365
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:02,389
if I don't have a strong pointer to it,

1366
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:06,760
what will happen to this timer var? It gets set to nil.

1367
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:10,130
Which is great. So this time the var will automatically set

1368
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,766
to nil as soon as the timer is stopped, which is a really

1369
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,502
nice feature. So I can always tell whether the times are on

1370
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,004
there, time there is running by

1371
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:18,705
whether that thing is nil or not. So

1372
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,343
it is kind of a cool feature. So how do you stop a repeating

1373
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,578
timer? You have timers going off every two seconds. Well,

1374
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,615
you just send the message invalidate to the timer and

1375
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:33,153
it will no longer run. In fact invalidate is going to throw

1376
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:37,858
it out of the heap and set our weak vars to nil and it's all

1377
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:41,862
gonna be done. So that's it. Super easy to use class timer,

1378
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:45,566
struct timer. Now timer, sorry, I thought I didn't put

1379
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,035
this tolerance in here. But the timer you can also specify

1380
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,103
a tolerance on your timer.

1381
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:52,773
That just says. If this timer goes off once an hour, it's

1382
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:55,542
okay if it goes off 30 seconds earlier or 30 seconds late.

1383
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,745
That's fine, and why would you wanna set a tolerance? Because

1384
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,615
it could help the system be a little more battery efficient.

1385
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:05,453
Cuz the system might not be awake exactly one hour later,

1386
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,820
it might be sleeping.

1387
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,623
But it might wake up to check cellular status or

1388
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:10,958
something like that, and then it could run it.

1389
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,493
So if you give it a little tolerance,

1390
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,461
it won't have to wake up specifically to try and

1391
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,097
run your timer. By the way, these timers,

1392
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,967
even if they have tolerance zero, they don't run right

1393
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:23,003
on the microsecond of what you specify. These are not

1394
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:27,441
microsecond level timers. They probably, I mean, in practice,

1395
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,144
they're probably a tenth or a hundredth of a second,

1396
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:33,047
very reliably. But these are not for real time animation or

1397
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:37,785
something like that. >> [INAUDIBLE]

1398
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,420
>> Yeah, so the question is,

1399
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,590
can the timer run when the app is in the background? And

1400
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,958
we haven't talked about the whole application life cycle,

1401
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,361
and when things are in the background, and

1402
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,595
I will talk about that. But

1403
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:51,198
the answer is, once the thing has gone to a suspended state,

1404
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:54,535
no, nothing runs in your app. But in that 30 seconds where

1405
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:58,005
it's not fully, you know, backgrounded,

1406
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:01,075
it could run in that short time. So we'll talk all about

1407
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,711
that when we talk about the application life cycle.

1408
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,779
What happens to your app when you go to another app, for

1409
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:10,684
example. Okay, so brief overview here of the kinds of

1410
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:14,088
animation that exist in iOS, or at least some of the kinds.

1411
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,024
One is animating UIView properties,

1412
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:18,459
there's a few UIView properties,

1413
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,127
very important ones which we'll talk about,

1414
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:22,262
that you can animate the changing of.

1415
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:26,234
Okay, this is the most common animation that goes on, okay,

1416
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:28,335
and we'll talk all about that one.

1417
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,571
Then there's animating controller transitions,

1418
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,673
this is like you're in the navigation controller, and

1419
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,610
a new card comes on top of the deck. The animation of that

1420
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:40,180
sliding in or popping in or flipping in, or whatever.

1421
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,883
That can be animated, we're not gonna talk anything about

1422
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:45,185
that. That's kind of an advanced animation topic,

1423
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,987
we're not gonna talk about that.

1424
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:48,655
There's core animation that,

1425
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,692
just like there's a CA layer underneath UI for drawing,

1426
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,262
there's kind of core animation under this UIView property

1427
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:57,898
animation at the top there, that I'm gonna talk about.

1428
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,134
I'm not gonna get into core animation much,

1429
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:03,170
it's basically the primitives for animating properties.

1430
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,839
It can animate more than just the UIView properties that I'm

1431
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,342
gonna talk about, but I just don't have time to get

1432
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:11,145
down to that layer. Even for UIView property animation,

1433
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:13,614
I'm just gonna kind of show you the real easy,

1434
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:16,517
top way to do it. Most of this class is really just

1435
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:19,553
trying to get you introduced to things, and you can look in

1436
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,723
more detail if you want to do more detailed stuff. If you're

1437
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,860
doing 3D, of course there's full 3D animation engine,

1438
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:28,829
OpenGL, and also Metal, which is a fantastic system for

1439
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:32,199
doing that. I'm not gonna talk about any 3D in this class

1440
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,302
either, so if you are a 3D person,

1441
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:37,104
I'm presuming you might already know OpenGL.

1442
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:40,241
You may know how to figure how to get your OpenGL into

1443
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,878
a view on you own, but it's not actually that difficult.

1444
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,714
There is also SpriteKit, a whole framework for

1445
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,349
doing 2.5D animation,

1446
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,919
basically that's like Mario Brothers kind of animation,

1447
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,988
right?. Where you have Images and they're overlapping to

1448
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:57,725
create what appears to kinda be a 3D world, but it's really

1449
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:01,495
drawn 2D, where the images just overlap. So there's whole

1450
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:03,664
mechanisms for that, not gonna talk about that either.

1451
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:05,732
Maybe we'll have a Friday section on that, possibly,

1452
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,234
later in the quarter. But I doubt it,

1453
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:11,004
cuz we've got some other things in the pipe for that.

1454
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,607
And finally, there's dynamic animation,

1455
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,376
this is animating views using physics. So

1456
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,946
you give the view a mass and a velocity and

1457
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,748
an elasticity, and then you operate on it.

1458
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,752
You push it, for example, and it'll just start flying across

1459
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,254
the screen. And depending on what its mass is and

1460
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:30,090
what it collides with, it'll bounce around and do various

1461
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,493
things. This I am going to tell you about on Wednesday.

1462
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:37,231
Because it's really great for kind of moving views at,

1463
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:40,033
on math and having them interact with each other.

1464
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,035
When you slide up from the bottom on your iPhone,

1465
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,637
and it kind of bounces a little bit,

1466
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,272
that's the dynamic animation, right?

1467
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,375
It's just kind of a little bit of elasticity and bounce.

1468
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:49,510
Let's wait on UIView animation,

1469
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:51,812
cuz I don't wanna rush this too much, so

1470
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,714
we'll start Wednesday off with this.

1471
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:57,417
UIView property animation is just these yellow properties

1472
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:00,154
right here on your view, like where it is, its center.

1473
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:02,623
Or the transform, remember the thing we did to rotate

1474
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:06,527
the View upside down when we made the corner of the card.

1475
01:16:06,596 --> 01:16:09,697
Or alpha how transparent it is, making things fade in and

1476
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,333
out, or the background color, which is rare to animate.

1477
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,068
These properties and these properties alone,

1478
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:18,572
you can animate, so that your view can fly across screen,

1479
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:21,842
it can fade out, it can flip around because its

1480
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,377
transformed can be changed. It can scale up and get big, and

1481
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,547
then go back small, because its scale,

1482
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:28,482
the transform scale can be changed, etc.

1483
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,884
So there's a whole API for animating these things,

1484
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:33,253
and that's what we'll start Wednesday's with.

1485
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,622
And then I'll do dynamic animation, then we'll do

1486
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:38,024
a demo, gonna be time constrained at that point, but

1487
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,828
we'll do a demo that includes all of that stuff, hopefully,

1488
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,296
in it. And then your assignment that's gonna

1489
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:45,399
be due on Wednesday is to set your set game and

1490
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,634
add animation to it. And

1491
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,570
there's also going to be another part for

1492
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,408
multiple MDCs. All right, sound good, all right,

1493
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:57,144
I'll see you next time. >> For more,
